Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are heterogeneous and functionally committed to producing interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17. γδT cells are defined as tissue-resident lymphocytes in barrier tissues. Among them, IL-17–producing γδT cells are relatively abundant in the liver. However, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the residency characteristics and function of hepatic IL-17A+ γδT cells is lacking.

We undertook a single-cell analysis of γδT17 cells derived from murine livers. A parabiosis model was used to assess tissue residency. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and adoptive transfer experiments were used to investigate the response and protective role of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in Listeria monocytogenes infection. Transwell assay was used to assess the role of macrophages in the chemotaxis of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells.

We identified hepatic IL-17A–producing γδT cells as CD44hiCD27− γδT cells. They had tissue-resident characteristics and resided principally within the liver. Vγ6+ T cells also exhibited liver-resident features. Liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells had significantly increased proliferation capacity, and their proportion rapidly increased after infection. Some CD44hiCD27− γδT cells could produce IL-17A and IFN-γ simultaneously in response to Lm infection. Adoptive transfer of hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells into Lm-infected TCRδ−/− mice led to markedly lower bacterial numbers in the liver. Hepatic macrophages promoted the migration and accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells into infection sites.

T cells are divided primarily into 2 distinct types, αβT and γδT, based on the combinational use of α, β, γ, and δ chains to form T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs). Gamma and delta T cells (γδT cells) represent a minority among all lymphocytes in blood or secondary lymphoid tissues but are highly enriched within barrier tissues (eg, skin, gut, lung).1 αβT cells require the recognition of classic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to be activated. γδT cells recognize antigens independent of the restriction of MHC molecules and do not require the processing and presentation of antigens.2 γδT cells, a unique subset of innate-like T lymphocytes that elicit rapid anti-infection responses, have attracted more attention.

The contribution of γδT cells to the immune response is associated with their rapid and abundant production of 2 critical cytokines: interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17A. IFN-γ–producing γδT cells (γδT1) and IL-17A–producing γδT cells (γδT17) can be segregated on the basis of expression status of several surface receptors. Cluster of differentiation (CD)27, lymphocyte antigen 6C, CD122, and CD45RB are commonly used to identify γδT1 cells. CCR6 and the high expression of CD44 are commonly used to identify γδT17 cells.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 γδT17 cells actually contain 2 distinct types, those expressing an invariant Vγ6Vδ1+ TCR and those expressing a Vγ4+ TCR in mice (Heilig and Tonegawa nomenclature).8,9 RAR-related orphan receptor gamma-t (RORγt) is the “master” transcription factor that controls the production of IL-17A.10,11 In addition, c-MAF, SRY-box transcription factor 4, SRY-box transcription factor 13, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 are key regulators of the development of γδT17 cells.12,13 γδT cells are relatively abundant in the liver (3%–5% within intrahepatic lymphocytes) and predominantly produce high levels of IL-17A compared with other immune organs and tissues (eg, spleen, lymph nodes).14 Tian’s group reported the liver residency of γδT cells and their role in accelerating the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.14 However, the systematic and comprehensive analysis of the hepatic γδT17 cell subset remains lacking.

Lm is an intracellular foodborne pathogen that crosses the intestinal barrier actively and reaches the liver, spleen, brain, and fetal-placental unit. A few notable studies have reported that γδT cells, especially γδT17 cells, orchestrate protective immune responses against Lm infection in the intestinal tissues and testis.19, 20, 21 γδT17 cells exhibit multifunctional and protective memory upon secondary challenge with oral Lm to provide enhanced protection against infection.19,20 Several studies have reported that IL-17A produced by γδT cells plays a critical role in host defense after Lm in the liver.22,23 Thus, γδT cells function as gatekeepers against Lm infection in many tissues and might have memory and plasticity characteristics. However, in those studies, the details of the phenotypes, dynamic changes, proliferation activity, and cytokine production of the responding γδT cell populations in the overall process of hepatic infection are unclear, and how they accumulated into the infection sites has not been elucidated.

Recently, we investigated the intrahepatic development of γδT cells derived from murine liver samples and defined 6 clusters of hepatic γδT cells using 10× genomics single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).24 In the present study, we focused on 2 important hepatic γδT subpopulations, γδT17 and γδT1 cells, especially γδT17 cells. We found that γδT17 cells had unique gene expression characteristics and identified them as CD44hiCD27− γδT cells by scRNA-seq and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Moreover, CD44hiCD27− γδT cells resided in the liver and contributed to early protection after Lm infection. The Vγ6+ cell subset among hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells may play a more predominant role during infection. Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MdMs) mediated the accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells into Lm infection sites. A deeper and more comprehensive insight into liver-resident γδT cells could promote the development of novel γδT cell-based therapeutic strategies against liver diseases.

Previously, we defined 6 clusters of murine hepatic γδT cells by scRNA-seq.24 Here, we further analyzed the gene expression characteristics of cluster of γδT17 cells. We compared the expression of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of γδT1 cells and γδT17 cells. Heatmaps revealed that the subset of γδT17 cells displayed gene expression profiles with regard to transcriptional regulators, transmembrane proteins, cytokine receptors, and chemokine receptors (Figure 1). The top-20 DEGs with up-regulated expression showed some specific signature genes (eg, Tmem176a/b, Capg, Cd163l (Scart1), S100a4) within the cluster of γδT17 cells (Figure 1A).Figure 1Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the gene expression profiles of hepatic γδT17 cells and γδT1 cells.

Expression values were scaled by logFC. (G) Selected annotation terms of the cluster of γδT17 cells in the liver using the Gene Ontology database.

Next, we analyzed the expression of genes of cytokines and effector molecules. Unsurprisingly, the cluster of γδT17 cells had high expression of Il17a and medium level expression of Il17f. Besides the high expression of Ifng, the cluster of γδT1 cells also showed high expression of the genes associated with cytotoxicity (including Gzma, Gzmb, and Nkg7) (Figure 1B). With regard to transcriptional programs, the cluster of γδT17 cells showed high expression of transcription factor gene sets associated with IL-17A, such as Rorc (RORγt), Rora (ROR-alpha), Sox13, and Maf (c-Maf). They also expressed Gata3 and Zbtb16 (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger). γδT1 cells expressed Tbx21 (T-bet), which is associated with IFN-γ production, and also expressed Ahr and Runx3 (Figure 1C). Several of these genes have been reported to participate in the development and differentiation of γδT cells.10, 11, 12,25 γδT17 and γδT1 cells have different gene expression profiles of cytokine receptors. γδT17 cells expressed higher levels of genes such as Il1r1, Il2ra, Il7r, Il18r1, Il23r, Il17ra, Il17re, and Il27ra (Figure 1D). γδT1 cells expressed high levels of Il2rb, Il10ra, Il10rb, and Il21r (Figure 1D). The protein expression of these cytokine receptors on hepatic γδT1 or γδT17 cells and whether hepatic γδT cells respond to these cytokines need to be further verified. Both clusters of γδT1 cells and γδT17 cells showed high expression of Cxcr3 and Cxcr6, which have roles in the recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells and NKT cells to the liver.26, 27, 28 The cluster of γδT17 cells had high expression of Ccr2 and Ccr6, consistent with previous observations (Figure 1E).6,29 Importantly, we found that genes involved in cell activation (eg, Nr4a1, Cd44, Cd69, Amica1, Prr7), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (eg, Phlda1, Traf1, Tnfrsf25, Tnfaip3, Tnf), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (eg, Nfkbia, Nfkbib) pathway had up-regulated expression in the cluster of γδT17 cells (Figure 1F). In addition, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the cluster of γδT17 cells was enriched specifically in genes associated with the immune response, cell activation, and positive regulation of the response to stimulus (Figure 1G). In summary, scRNA-seq revealed the unique gene expression characteristics and indicated the possible important roles in immune responses of hepatic γδT17 cells. However, the protein expression level and precise function must be further verified.

We detected the expression levels of IL-17A and IFN-γ of γδT cells from the liver as well as spleen, thymus, inguinal lymph node (iLN), and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs); we observed that unlike γδT cells in other tissues, γδT cells in the liver expressed significantly high levels of IL-17A rather than IFN-γ (Figure 2A and B). Expression of CD44 and CD27 has been used to distinguish IL-17A–, IFN-γ–producing, and other subsets of γδT cells in the thymus, lymph nodes, lungs, and other peripheral lymphoid tissues.3,18 Whether the 2 markers are suitable for the subpopulation distinction of hepatic γδT cells was still uncertain.Figure 2CD44hiCD27−γδT cells were abundant within the liver and produced IL-17A predominantly.

To comprehensively understand the characteristics of γδT-cell subsets in the liver, we analyzed the expression of Cd44 and Cd27 in γδT cells with scRNA-seq data. Heatmaps and violin plots showed that Cd44 had high expression in Il17a+ γδT cells and moderate expression in Ifng+ γδT cells. Cd27 had high expression in Ifng+ γδT cells but negative expression in Il17a+ γδT cells (Figure 2C and D). The Il17a+ cluster carried a CD44hiCD27− phenotype, and the Ifng+ cluster had a CD44+CD27+ phenotype, which is in accordance with that in other tissues according to previous studies.3,18

Next, the expression of CD44 and CD27 in hepatic γδT cells from different tissues was examined by flow cytometry. We found that the liver was rich in CD44hiCD27− γδT cells, followed closely by CD44+CD27+ γδT cells. The spleen, thymus, and iLN had a low percentage of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells and were predominantly rich in CD44low γδT cells (Figure 2E and F). Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of the cytokines IL-17A and IFN-γ in subsets of γδT cells. We found that CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver and other tissues predominantly expressed IL-17A and seldom expressed IFN-γ. In contrast, CD44+CD27+ γδT cells predominantly expressed IFN-γ. CD44low γδT cells, possibly in the naive state, produced little IFN-γ (Figure 2E and G). These results verified that CD44 and CD27 as surface markers are also suitable for hepatic γδT cells to distinguish IL-17A– from IFN-γ–producing γδT cells. Among them, IL-17A–producing γδT cells were abundant in the liver and could be identified as a subset of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells. IFN-γ+ γδT cells were mainly of the CD44+CD27+ phenotype.

Heatmaps (Figure 1) revealed that the cluster of γδT17 cells was enriched in the IL-17A–related transcription factors Rorc (RORγt), whereas the cluster of γδT1 cells had high expression of Tbx21 (T-bet). The cluster of γδT17 cells also expressed Zbtb16 (PLZF), which is associated with innate tissue-resident lymphocytes such as invariant NKT cells and mucosal-associated invariant T cells.30 The expression of transcription factors was further examined by flow cytometry. Consistent with the scRNA-seq results, we found that hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells had high expression of the transcription factor RORγt, whereas CD44+CD27+ γδT cells had high expression of the IFN-γ–related transcription factor T-bet and low expression of RORγt (Figure 3A and B). Compared with the other 2 subsets, hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells had higher expression of PLZF (Figure 3C and D). It has been reported that IL-17A–producing γδT cells contain Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ T subpopulations.14 Thus, we investigated whether hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells have the heterogeneity that contain Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ subsets. We detected the percentages of Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ T cells in hepatic IL-17A–producing CD44hiCD27− γδT cells by flow cytometry. Because we did not obtain commercial antibody specific for the Vγ6 TCR chain, we used a dump gate approach31,32 to identify Vγ6+ T cells. γδT cells were labeled with monoclonal antibodies against a combined group of Vγ1, Vγ2, Vγ5, and Vγ7 (ie, Vγ1257+) versus a monoclonal antibody against Vγ4 (ie, Vγ4+) (Figure 3E). Vγ6+ T cells were the unlabeled negative γδT cell population (ie, Vγ1257− Vγ4−). The results showed that hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells were heterogeneous and were composed of Vγ6+ (67.27% ± 4.82%) and Vγ4+ (25.57% ± 4.82%) T cells (Figure 3E and F).Figure 3Expression of transcription factors and Vγ chain of hepatic CD44hiCD27−γδT cells.

Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.

In summary, the expression of CD44 and CD27 can be used to divide hepatic γδT cells into 3 subsets, CD44hiCD27−, CD44+CD27+, and CD44low, as in other peripheral lymphoid organs. CD44hiCD27− γδT cells were abundant in the liver and expressed RORγt and produced IL-17A predominantly. Furthermore, hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells were heterogeneous and consisted of a large proportion of Vγ6+ T cells and a small portion of Vγ4+ T cells.

γδT cells represent the major population of lymphocytes on mucosal surfaces (eg, intestinal epithelium, epidermis), where they were defined as tissue-resident populations.33 Because of the finding that γδT cells were relatively abundant in the liver, we explored the tissue-resident characteristics of hepatic γδT cells. Heatmaps showed the expression of tissue-resident–related genes in the hepatic cluster of γδT17 cells and γδT1 cells (Figure 4A). Compared with the γδT1-cell cluster, the γδT17-cell cluster was associated with higher expression of Cxcr6 and lower expression of Cxcr3, which are important for “liver homing” and accumulation of NK cells and NKT cells in the liver (Figure 4A).26, 27, 28 Furthermore, the cluster of γδT17 cells showed high expression of Itgae (CD103), Itgb7, and Cd69, which are involved in the adhesive and retentive interactions of leukocytes (Figure 4A).34 We detected the protein expression of these tissue-resident–related molecules by flow cytometry (Figure 4B). Compared with IL-17A–producing CD44hiCD27− γδT cells from the spleen and thymus, as well as CD44+CD27+ and CD44low γδT cells from the liver, hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells had higher expression of CXCR6, CD49a, and CD69 (Figure 4C–F). CD103 expression was lower in hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells compared with that in other subsets of cells (Figure 4D and F). Then, we analyzed the mRNA expression of select genes reflecting lymph node-homing and tissue egress, which is down-regulated in tissue-resident lymphocytes.35,36 We found that the clusters of γδT17 cells and γδT1 cells lacked expression of the lymphoid-homing genes Ccr7 and Sell (CD62L) (Figure 4G). With regard to genes required for tissue egress, γδT17 cells seldom expressed S1pr2 and S1pr5 (Figure 4G). Flow cytometry confirmed that hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells barely expressed CD62L and had low expression of CCR7 (Figure 4H and I). These data hinted that compared with CD44+CD27+ γδT cells, intrahepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells had more significant tissue-resident characteristics because they had higher expression of adhesion molecules and low expression of lymphoid-homing markers.Figure 4Intrahepatic CD44hiCD27−γδT cells had a tissue-resident phenotype.

One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed in C–F, H, and I. ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001.

To further confirm the tissue residency of hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells, we generated parabiotic mice with the CD45-congenic mice (Figure 5A). Peripheral blood lymphocytes circulated readily after 2 weeks of parabiosis (Figure 5B). We first investigated the redistribution of γδT cells of the parabiotic mice (Figure 5C). Most γδT cells from IELs (94.03% ± 4.55%) were host origin (Figure 5D and E), which confirmed their non-circulating feature and is consistent with previous research.37 Similarly, 80.11% ± 7.61% of hepatic γδT cells were host origin (Figure 5D and E). A large population of thymic γδT cells (80.89% ± 6.64%) was retained locally, but splenic γδT cells were mutually exchanged (55.96% ± 5.05%) (Figure 5D and E). Then the residency of different γδT subsets was analyzed. We found that CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver were almost entirely of host origin (92.02% ± 4.54%), whereas CD44low γδT cells displayed a circulating phenotype (53.17% ± 9.14%). Among hepatic CD44+CD27+ γδT cells, the majority of the cells retained locally, but there were still some cells showing circulating features (Figure 5F and G). The 3 subsets of γδT cells were also resident in the thymus, whereas they were freely exchanged in the spleen (Figure 5F and G). It has been reported that Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ T cells have different tissue residency in peripheral lymph nodes, thymus, and skin.38 We wondered whether Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ γδT cells have tissue residency in the liver. We found that Vγ6+ T cells mainly resided in the liver (91.16% ± 3.76%), whereas 76.03% ± 6.87% of Vγ4+ γδT cells retained locally. However, in the spleen, both Vγ4+ (54.44% ± 8.67%) and Vγ6+ (54.71% ± 7.19%) T cells completely equilibrated after parabiosis (Figure 5H and I).Figure 5Hepatic CD44hiCD27−γδT cells were resident mainly in the liver.

(D and E) Host origin (CD45.1+ or CD45.2+) of γδT cells in IELs, liver, thymus, and spleen was identified by FACS analysis in CD45.1/CD45.2 parabiotic mouse pairs 14 days after surgery. Green columns and white columns represent percentages of CD45.1+ cells and CD45.2+cells, respectively (n = 8). (F and G) Host origin (CD45.1+ or CD45.2+) of the 3 γδT-cell subsets in the liver, thymus, and spleen was identified by FACS analysis in CD45.1/CD45.2 parabiotic mouse pairs 14 days after surgery. Green columns and white columns represent percentages of CD45.1+ cells and CD45.2+cells, respectively (n = 8). (H and I) Origin (CD45.1+ or CD45.2+) of the Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ T cells in the liver and spleen was identified by FACS analysis in CD45.1/CD45.2 parabiotic mouse 14 days after surgery.

Representative data are shown as mean ± standard deviation from 3 independent experiments.

In summary, these data suggested that hepatic IL-17A–producing CD44hiCD27− γδT cells had tissue-resident profiles and were principally resident in the liver. Compared with Vγ4+ γδT cells, hepatic Vγ6+ γδT cells displayed more prominent liver-resident features.

Several studies have suggested that γδT cells participate in protective immunity during Lm infection.19,22,39,40 To comprehensively explore the role of hepatic γδT cells in protection against Lm infection, a model of Lm infection was established in wild-type (WT) mice and TCRδ−/− mice. We found that Lm-infected TCRδ−/− mice displayed more significant body weight loss than WT mice (Figure 6A). Then, we examined bacterial load in the liver at different time points. Bacterial numbers in the liver were significantly higher in TCRδ−/− mice than those in WT mice 3 days and 5 days after infection (Figure 6B). Then, we challenged mice with a high dose of Lm to observe the survival time and found that the overall survival of TCRδ−/− mice was reduced significantly compared with that of WT mice (Figure 6C). As expected, the proportion and absolute numbers of γδT cells in the liver of WT mice increased at day 3 and reached a peak at day 7 after infection (Figure 6D and E). These data suggested that hepatic γδT cells proliferated after infection and contributed to Lm clearance. We further detected the percentages of γδTCR+ cells from IL-17A– or IFN-γ–producing T cells of the infected liver. As shown in Figure 6F, γδT cells (γδTCR+ cells) represented about 80% of IL-17A–producing T cells at day 7 after infection. This is consistent with previous reports that γδT cells (but not αβT cells) were the predominant source of IL-17A after the Lm challenge.19, 20, 21, 22,41,42 Although IFN-γ was produced primarily by αβT cells, the contribution of γδT cells increased relative to that of uninfected status (Figure 6G). Unlike early-active γδT cells, the proportion of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells increased later than γδT cells and began to increase 5–7 days after Lm infection (Figure 6H and I). These results agreed with other studies stating that innate immune responses are essential for early control of Lm infection, and the CD4 or CD8-mediated adaptive immune response follows the innate immune response.43 Our observation further confirmed the importance of hepatic γδT cells in protection against Lm infection in the early stage.Figure 6Hepatic γδT cells responded to and defended against Lm infection.

Gene expression profiles and GO enrichment analysis indicated that the cluster of hepatic γδT17 cells showed activation-related gene expression characteristics and might be involved in the immune response (Figure 1). We wanted to investigate whether liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells play a more important role in protection against Lm infection. Hence, we examined the CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver after intravenous inoculation with Lm. Three days after infection, the proportion of hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells increased and persisted up to 14 days after infection (Figure 7A), whereas the proportion of CD44+CD27+ γδT cells decreased as infection progressed and was maintained at a low level (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B, liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells presented low mitotic activity at a steady state, as evidenced by the low expression of Ki67. Notably, upon Lm infection, a significantly increased proliferation capacity of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver was documented. The proliferation of Lm-induced liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells was detectable as early as 24 hours after infection, peaked at 3 days, persisted up to 7 days, and returned to a normal level as infection progressed (Figure 7B). The bacterial burden peaked at 3 days and was cleared before 10 days (Figure 7C). These results suggest that liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells accumulate in infection sites and proliferate rapidly, thus participating in early defense against Lm infection.Figure 7Liver-resident CD44hiCD27−γδT cells proliferated rapidly and contributed to clearance of Lm.

Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The DP-L5538 Lm strain is RFP. Scale bars, 20 μm. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (A–C, F, and G), median, quartiles, and range (H). One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed in A, B, and H. Two-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed in G. ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Next, we evaluated the cytokine-producing abilities of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells. Surprisingly, we noticed that there are 3 distinct cytokine-producing profiles of hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells, particularly after 5 days after infection (Figure 7D). At day 5, approximately 30% of hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells produced IL-17A, whereas 30% produced IFN-γ. Most importantly, a substantial population of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells could produce IL-17A and IFN-γ simultaneously (Figure 7D). The proportion of IL-17A– and IFN-γ–producing CD44hiCD27− γδT cells peaked 7 days after infection and remained high during infection (Figure 7D). In comparison, CD44+CD27+ γδT cells produced IFN-γ stably and exclusively (Figure 7E).

Owing to the heterogeneous nature of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells, which consist of Vγ6+ and Vγ4+ T cells (Figure 3), and a number of reported functional differences between Vγ6+ and Vγ4+ γδT17 cells,8 to confirm the contribution of the Vγ6+ and Vγ4+ subsets of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells during Lm infection, we analyzed the dynamic changes of these two CD44hiCD27− γδT subsets in Lm-infected mice. At 24 hours after infection, the frequency of Vγ4+ T cells slightly increased while decreased from day 3 after infection and then maintained at a low level, whereas the frequency of Vγ6+ T cells significantly increased and constituted nearly 80% of the hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells from day 7 after infection (Figure 7F). Meanwhile, the absolute numbers of Vγ6+ T cells increased after infection and reached a peak at day 7 after infection, whereas Vγ4+ T cells maintained in low numbers (Figure 7F). These results indicated that after “sensing” Lm in the liver, the Vγ6+ subset might play a major role in Lm clearance.

We wished to ascertain whether liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells played a part in protection against Lm infection. Hence, we established a model of Lm infection in WT mice, TCRδ−/− mice, and TCRδ−/− mice that underwent adoptive transfer with liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells. Body weight loss was more profound in TCRδ−/− mice compared with that in TCRδ−/− mice that received CD44hiCD27− γδT cells (Figure 7G). At 3 days and 5 days after infection, TCRδ−/− mice that received CD44hiCD27− γδT cells exhibited markedly lower bacterial numbers in the liver than TCRδ−/− mice that did not receive CD44hiCD27− γδT cells (Figure 7H and I). These data suggested that liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells were important for rapidly controlling Lm in the liver.

Lm-elicited γδT cells in the liver and spleen in Lm-infected mice. In contrast to the circulating splenic γδT cells, whose percentages of both CD45.1+ and Lm-infected CD45.2+ mice almost equilibrated after parabiosis, CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver of CD45.2+

Lm-infected mice were almost entirely of CD45.2+ origin (nearly 95%) (Figure 8B). These results indicated that Lm-elicited CD44hiCD27− γδT cells still maintained liver-resident features after Lm infection. The increased number of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver of Lm-infected mice might be from the migration and proliferation of local liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells but not from circulating γδT cells.Figure 8KCs and MdMs contributed to accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27−γδT cell after Lm infection. (A) CD45.1+ mice and congenic CD45.2+Lm-immune mice were sutured together to establish a parabiosis model for 2 weeks (left).

One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed in E. ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Macrophages are the main effector cells that destroy invading intracellular bacteria. During pathogen infection, hepatic macrophages are important in the initial response, not only directly killing the intracellular pathogen but also promoting the recruitment of other immune cells by rapidly producing cytokines and chemokines.44 KCs are the resident tissue macrophages of the liver and participate in innate responses to Lm infection.43,45 We found that the proportion of KCs dropped at 3 days after infection but was restored at 10 days. In parallel, MdMs accumulated in the first 3 days and returned to initial percentages 10 days after infection (Figure 8C). A significantly increased proliferation capacity of KCs and MdMs was observed in the liver in response to Lm infection (Figure 8D). We tried to explore whether there is a cooperation between macrophages and γδT cells in the process of defending against and clearance of Lm infection. A Transwell assay was performed to test the chemotactic ability of hepatic macrophages on liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells (Figure 8E). When the lower chamber contained KCs from uninfected mice, CD44hiCD27− γδT cells were recruited from the above inserts. Chemotaxis was significantly increased when the lower chamber contained KCs or MdMs from Lm-infected mice, indicating that the KCs and MdMs, especially the KCs, played important roles in the accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells (Figure 8E). These results indicate that KCs and MdMs promoted the migration and accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells into the infection foci of the liver to play a protective immune response.

γδT cells are located in mucosal tissues and other peripheral lymphoid tissues and are considered to act as the first line of defense within the immune system.2,39 Increasing studies have focused on γδT cells, including the tissue residency in barrier tissues and immune defense against infections.2,33 Our previous study has defined the unique characteristics of hepatic γδT cells concerning heterogeneity, origins, and differentiation.24 In the present study, we identified hepatic IL-17A–producing γδT cells as CD44hiCD27− γδT cells, which consisted of Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ cell subsets, and then explored their gene expression profiles and liver-resident characteristics. We mainly examined the protection of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells during Lm infection. We demonstrated that IL-17A–producing liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells played important roles in the clearance of Lm infection, which is consistent with previous reports.22,42 Furthermore, we found that the CD44hiCD27− γδT cells may have functional plasticity that can produce both IL-17A and IFN-γ in response to Lm infection. Our study, in conjunction with other published work,19 suggested that the abundance of IL-17A and IFN-γ produced by CD44hiCD27− γδT cells contributed to protection against Lm infection. In agreement with previous research, we found that the Vγ6+ cell subset also exhibited liver-resident features and might play a more predominant role during infection.20 Moreover, we verified that hepatic macrophages promoted the migration and accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells into infection sites. Our findings provide cues on the tissue residency and protective immune mechanisms of γδT17 cells that might be exploited for new strategies against intracellular bacterial infection.

Lymphocytes circulate continuously in blood, lymph nodes, and other secondary lymphoid organs. However, studies have demonstrated the existence and importance of tissue-resident lymphocytes that reside in the liver. These liver-resident lymphocytes are particularly important for local immunosurveillance, immune regulation, and maintaining liver homeostasis.46 Liver-resident lymphocytes share similar characteristics in terms of phenotypes, transcriptional regulation, and function.47, 48, 49 In our study, we identified IL-17A–producing γδT cells as CD44hiCD27− γδT cells and verified their liver-resident characteristics, consistent with Tian’s study that hepatic γδT cells were resident in the liver and predominantly produced IL-17A.14 Hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells showed high expression of adhesive and retentive molecules (eg, CD49a, CD69) compared with those in the spleen or thymus. They also had high expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR6 and CXCR3 but low expression of the lymph node-homing molecules CD62L and CCR7 (Figure 4). Our parabiosis model further confirmed that CD44hiCD27− γδT cells reside in the liver (Figure 5). Furthermore, we found that CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in the liver are heterogeneous and are composed of 2 major subsets, Vγ6+ (67.27% ± 4.82%) and Vγ4+ (25.57% ± 4.82%) T cells (Figure 3).

Research has shown that Vγ6+ T cells mainly reside in peripheral lymph nodes, thymus, and skin.38 We explored the tissue residency of Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ T cells in the liver and found that Vγ6+ T cells mainly resided in the liver. Whereas the majority of Vγ4+ T cells retained locally, there were still some Vγ4+ T cells displaying circulating features (Figure 5). This is the first study to verify the liver-resident features of Vγ6+ γδT cells, suggesting their potential role in liver immunosurveillance. Our previous study showed that IFN-γ–producing CXCR3+CXCR6+ γδT cells reside specifically in the liver and have a protective role during acute HBV infection.50 Notably, we found that IFN-γ–producing CD44+CD27+ γδT cells also exhibited liver-resident features. The hepatic CXCR3+CXCR6+ γδT cells that we studied previously may be a subset of CD44+CD27+ γδT cells and reside in the liver.50 This indicates that there are distinct tissue-resident γδT cells in the liver and may exert different effects under various pathologic conditions.

γδT cells mediate crucial responses to a range of pathogens by rapidly producing large amounts of cytokines as well as interacting with other subsets of immune cells.51,52 In the current study, we observed that γδT cells accumulated rapidly at an early phase after infection and became the predominant source of IL-17A in the liver to protect against Lm infection (Figure 6). These observations were in agreement with previous research.22,23,42 Interestingly, through observation of the dynamic changes and cytokine production of hepatic CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in response to Lm infection, we found that the CD44hiCD27− γδT cells obtained the capacity to produce both IL-17A and IFN-γ, particularly from day 5 after infection (Figure 7). A previous study also showed that Vγ6/Vδ1+ γδT cells controlled the innate protective response against Lm infection by producing IFN-γ and IL-17A in the infected liver.23 In addition, Sheridan et al have also shown that mesenteric lymph nodes resident Vγ4+ T cells (Garman nomenclature, equivalent to the Vγ6+ T cells using Heilig and Tonegawa nomenclature),9,53 which had a CD44hiCD27− phenotype, simultaneously produced IFN-γ and IL-17A in response to oral Lm infection.19 The co-expression of IL-17A and IFN-γ by CD27− γδT cells has also been explored in autoimmunity, cancer, and infection in mice as well as in HIV-1–infected patients.19,54, 55, 56 An epigenomic analysis provided evidence that CD27+ γδT cells were committed to the expression of Ifng (but not Il17), whereas CD27− γδT cells that acquired the ability to produce IL-17A during thymic development were nonetheless endowed with functional plasticity to co-express IL-17A and IFN-γ upon stimulation with high amounts of IL-1β and IL-23 or in a highly inflammatory tumor microenvironment.7,54 The plasticity of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells was probably triggered under specific local inflammatory conditions and might thus contribute to their antibacterial function during Lm infection. Besides, other cytokines and signaling pathways were also involved in the plasticity of γδT cells under pathologic states, such as IL-2, TLR4 signaling, and microRNA-146a/NOD1 axis.55,57,58 Additional studies are needed to explain the functional plasticity of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells upon Lm infection.

Importantly, in our study, the protective role of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells was confirmed by the fact that the severity of infection was reduced after the adoptive transfer of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells into TCRδ−/− mice (Figure 7). Several studies have explored the mechanism by which IL-17A–producing γδT cells are involved in protective immune responses against Lm infection. IL-23 regulated the production of IL-17A from γδT cells during Lm infection.42 γδT17 cells protected against Lm infection by organizing CD11b+ myeloid cell granulomas surrounding Lm infection foci or enhancing dendritic cell cross-presentation to promote the proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.20,41 This indicates that γδT17 cells may play a role as a bridge for regulating of innate and adaptive immunity. The precise mechanism of how Lm-elicited liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells take part in the protection against Lm infection requires further study.

Interestingly, a study revealed that Lm-elicited memory Vγ4+ T (Garman nomenclature) cells were broadly reactive and responded to multiple pathogenic bacteria, such as Lm, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Citrobacter rodentium.32 This finding describes the broad-spectrum immune response of memory γδT cells and suggests that pathogen-elicited memory γδT cells are novel targets for multifunctional anti-infective vaccines. Another prominent study by Romagnoli et al20 reported that CXCR3 enabled the local redistribution and migration of memory Vγ4+ T (Garman nomenclature) cells, specifically near Lm infection sites within the mesenteric lymph nodes, to restrict bacterial spread. Our results showed that KCs and MdMs promoted the migration and accumulation of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells upon infection (Figure 8). The parabiosis experiments confirmed that KCs and MdMs recruited liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells from local liver tissues, rather than spleen or blood, into the infected focus to protect against infection. There is evidence that the IL-17A pathway is involved in the host defense against bacterial infections by inducing the production of various molecules (such as chemokines, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides) from macrophages.59 Whether IL-17A secreted from liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells induces the activation of hepatic macrophages needs additional research.

In summary, we identified CD44hiCD27− γδT cells as a liver-resident subset of γδT cells, and that they possessed functional plasticity to co-express IL-17A and IFN-γ upon Lm infection. Hepatic macrophages promoted the migration and accumulation of liver-resident CD44hiCD27− γδT cells to contribute to the clearance of Lm at the early stage of infection. Our study provides additional insight into liver-resident lymphocytes and will aid in targeting such tissue-resident lymphocyte populations to promote local immune surveillance.

Male C57BL/6J (B6, CD45.2+) mice (5–10 weeks) were purchased from Beijing Hua Fukang Bioscience (Beijing, China). C57BL/6-Ly5.1 (CD45.1+) mice were obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing, China). C57BL/6J-derived T-cell receptor δ chain (TCRδ) knockout (B6.129P2-Tcrdtm1Mom/J) mice were sourced from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were bred in a specific pathogen-free facility under ethical conditions. Experiments were undertaken with age- and sex-matched animals according to the guidelines for experimental animals set by Shandong University.

Our group undertook single-cell analysis of γδT cells derived from murine livers. All sequencing data have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) depository under the accession number GEO: GSE164106.24 ScRNA-seq analyses were processed as previously described24 and were performed by CapitalBio Technology. Briefly, the Seurat R package (v3.3.1) was used for quality control, filtering, and clustering. Cells that had a gene number lower than 800 or higher than 4000 were filtered out. Any cell with mitochondrial unique molecular identifier counts greater than 6% or ribosomal unique molecular identifier counts greater than 50% was also removed. A total of 5835 single cells from liver samples were analyzed together. GO enrichment analysis was performed by using KOBAS software with the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment using the top 20 marker genes of the cluster. Enrichment scores (P values) for selected numbers of GO annotations were calculated with a hypergeometrical statistical test with a threshold of 0.05. The data were plotted as –log10 of the P value after Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

Single-cell suspensions were isolated from the iLN, spleen, liver, thymus, and intestine as described previously.50 Briefly, iLN, thymus, and spleens were passed through a 200-gauge steel mesh and then centrifuged (400g, 5 minutes, room temperature). Mononuclear cells (MNCs) of spleens were lysed with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer. Livers were homogenized and passed through a 200-gauge steel mesh. MNCs were purified further with 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) by centrifugation (800g, 25 minutes, room temperature) and then harvested after treatment with RBC lysis buffer and washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). IELs were isolated from the small intestine by centrifugation in a gradient of 40% Percoll and 70% Percoll as described previously.60,61

MNCs in single-cell suspensions were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and then stained for 30 minutes at 4°C with a “cocktail” of antibodies. For staining of transcription factors and Ki67 in the nucleus, the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) was used. To measure cytokine production, cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (30 ng/mL; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) and ionomycin (1 μg/mL; Millipore Sigma) for 4 hours and treated with monensin (1 μg/mL; Millipore Sigma) and brefeldin A (1 μg/mL; Biolegend, San Diego, CA) after 1 hour of stimulation. After surface staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the indicated intracellular antibodies. FACSymphony A3 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used for flow cytometry, and data were analyzed and visualized by FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR). The fluorescent antibodies used in this study are shown in Table 1.Table 1Mouse Antibodies Used in the Present StudyMarkerCloneFluorVendorCD3ε145-2C11PE/Cyanine7BiolegendCD3ε145-2C11Percp-Cy5.5BiolegendTCR γ/δGL3APCBiolegendCD183 (CXCR3)CXCR3-173PEBiolegendCD44IM7APC/Cyanine7BiolegendCD27LG.3A10Brilliant Violet 421BiolegendIFN-γXMG1.2PEBiolegendIFN-γXMG1.2PE/Dazzle 594BiolegendIL-17ATC11-18H10.1Brilliant Violet 421BiolegendPLZF9E12PE/Cyanine7BiolegendCD69H1.2F3PE/Cyanine7BiolegendCD45.2104APC/Cyanine7BiolegendCD1032E7Brilliant Violet 421BiolegendCCR74B12PE/Cyanine7BiolegendKi-6716A8Brilliant Violet 421BiolegendTCR Vγ1.1+1.24B2.9PEBiolegendTCR Vγ3536PEBiolegendTCR Vγ2UC3-10A6FITCBiolegendCD62LMEL-14V450BD BiosciencesCD45.1A20PE-CF594BD BiosciencesCD49aHα31/8Alexa Fluor 647BD BiosciencesTCR Vγ7F2.67PEBD BiosciencesROR gamma (t)B2DPE-eFluor 610eBioscienceT-beteBio4B10PE-Cyanine7eBioscienceCXCR6221002APCR&D Systems

Parabiosis involves combining 2 living organisms; they are joined surgically to develop a single, shared physiological system. Male CD45.1+ and CD45.2+ C57BL/6J mice (5–6 weeks) underwent lateral skin incisions. Skin from the subcutaneous fascia was detached gently. The elbow joint and knee joint were tied together by using nylon sutures. Skin from the elbow toward the knee was attached tightly with a nonabsorbable (4-0) suture. Neomycin was added to drinking water for 7 days. By ∼2 weeks after surgery, 2 mice shared the blood circulation. The liver, spleen, thymus, and small intestine were collected 4 weeks after surgery to assess γδT cells.

Lm-RFP (DP-L5538), which expresses tagRFP under the actA promoter, was provided by Professor Ying Wan (Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China). For infection, frozen stocks of Lm were thawed and grown in fresh brain–heart infusion (BHI) medium to reach mid-log growth phase. In the experiment to measure bacterial burden, mice (6 weeks) were injected (intravenously) via the lateral tail vein with Lm (3.5 × 105 colony-forming units suspended in 200 μL of PBS). In the survival-curve experiment, mice were injected (intravenously) with Lm (1 × 106 colony-forming units).

Single-cell suspensions were isolated from the liver. They were stained with anti-CD3e, anti-TCRγ/δ, anti-CD44, or anti-CD27 antibodies, and CD44hiCD27− γδT cells were sorted with a cell sorter (MoFlo Astrios EQ; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The purity of the sorted cell populations was >95%. Approximately 50,000 purified CD44hiCD27− γδT cells in 1 × PBS (200 μL) were injected (intravenously) into sublethally irradiated TCRδ−/− mice (6.5 Gy given 1 day before adoptive transfer). A model of Lm infection was established in WT mice, TCRδ−/− mice, and TCRδ−/− mice after adoptive transfer of CD44hiCD27− γδT cells.

Livers were removed from infected sacrificed mice and homogenized separately with a tissue grinder. Cell suspensions were diluted serially in 1× PBS and plated on BHI agar plates. After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, colony-forming units were counted.

Freshly isolated livers were frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and stored at −80°C. Frozen sections of 5 μm thickness were cut by using a cryostat (CM1850; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and air-dried before storage at −80°C. Sections were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Red fluorescent protein (RFP) and DAPI were imaged by using laser lines of 561 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Images were acquired by using a high-speed confocal platform (Dragonfly 200; Andor, Oxford, UK) and processed by using Fiji (Tokyo, Japan) software.

Hepatic γδT cells were seeded at 5 × 105 in 100 μL serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in the above inserts with a pore size of 5 μm. The lower chamber contained 500 μL Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with KCs or MdMs from uninfected mice or Lm-infected mice at 37°C for 2 hours. After 2-hour incubation, absolute numbers of the migrated cells were detected by FACSAria III.

Statistical analyses were carried out by using GraphPad Prism 9.5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The unpaired Student t test was used to compare the differences between 2 groups. Ordinary one-way analysis of variance was used to compare values obtained from more than 2 groups with 1 independent variable. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the body weight tests. P < .05 was considered significant.
