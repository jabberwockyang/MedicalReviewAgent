During the past decade there has been a revolution in cancer therapeutics by the emergence of antibody-based and cell-based immunotherapies that modulate immune responses against tumors. These new therapies have extended and improved the therapeutic efficacy of chemo-radiotherapy and have offered treatment options to patients who are no longer responding to these classic anti-cancer treatments. Unfortunately, tumor eradication and long-lasting responses are observed in a small fraction of patients, whereas the majority of patients respond only transiently. These outcomes indicate that the maximum potential of immunotherapy has not been reached due to incomplete knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that guide the development of successful anti-tumor immunity and its failure. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries about the immune cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the role of key signaling mechanisms that compromise the function of immune cells leading to cancer immune escape.
