Sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P) is a lipid mediator involved in diverse biological processes, from vascular and neural development to the regulation of lymphocyte trafficking. Many of its functions are regulated by five widely expressed S1P G-protein coupled receptors (S1P1-5). S1P is produced mostly intracellularly, thus, much of its potential as an autocrine and paracrine mediator depends on how, when, and where it is generated or secreted out of the cells. However, S1P can also have intracellular activity independent of its receptors, adding to the complexity of S1P function. The mast cell, a major effector cell during an allergic response, has proven instrumental towards understanding the complex regulation and function of S1P. Antigen (Ag) engagement of the IgE receptor in mast cells stimulates sphingosine kinases, which generate S1P and are involved in the activation of calcium fluxes critical for mast cell responses. In addition, mast cells secrete considerable amounts of S1P upon activation, thus affecting the surrounding tissues and recruiting inflammatory cells. Export of S1P is also involved in the autocrine transactivation of S1P receptors present in mast cells. The in vivo response of mast cells, however, is not strictly dependent on their ability to generate S1P, but they are also affected by changes in S1P in the environment previous to Ag challenge. This review will discuss the recent advances towards understanding the intricacies of S1P generation, secretion and regulation in mast cells. In addition, how S1P receptors are activated and their involvement in mast cell functions will also be covered, including new insights on the role of S1P in the mast cell-mediated allergic response of systemic anaphylaxis.
