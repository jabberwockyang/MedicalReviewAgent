Michael A. Caligiuri Twenty-five years ago, I was “on call” as an uninspired third-year medical student at Stanford, and admitted a kidney transplant patient with renal failure secondary to acute rejection. We tried using an experimental drug called cyclosporine to see if, in the words of my resident, “we could trick the patient's T cells into thinking the renal graft was not foreign.” Soon, the patient was urinating again. That moment was like a lightning bolt for me: I saw the application of basic pharmacology to clinical medicine in the setting of transplantation immunology. From that day on, I knew that the application of basic immunology to the field of clinical transplantation was where I was going. Once I found out you needed to be a surgeon to transplant most tissues, the idea of bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies became very, very appealing! It is gratifying to see that after a quarter of a century, the secrets of natural killer cell receptor biology are being revealed and quickly applied to cure cancer in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. For the students: When my kids tell me I work hard, I tell them I get paid well to do my hobby. Find and pursue your passion. The rewards will follow.

Natural killer (NK) cells were discovered more than 30 years ago. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that belong to the innate immune system because unlike T or B lymphocytes of the adaptive or antigen-specific immune system, NK cells do not rearrange T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes from their germline configuration. During the past 2 decades there has been a substantial gain in our understanding of what and how NK-cells “see,” lending important insights into their functions and purpose in normal immune surveillance. The most recent discoveries in NK-cell receptor biology have fueled translational research that has led to remarkable results in treating human malignancy.
