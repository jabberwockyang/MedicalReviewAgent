Long noncoding RNAs are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biologic processes. In vertebrates, the number of long noncoding RNA genes is thought to greatly exceed the number of protein‐coding genes. It is also thought that long noncoding RNAs drive the biologic complexity observed in vertebrates compared with that in invertebrates. Evidence of this complexity has been found in the T‐lymphocyte compartment of the adaptive immune system. In the present review, we describe our current level of understanding of the expression of specific long or large intergenic or intervening long noncoding RNAs during T‐lymphocyte development in the thymus and differentiation in the periphery and highlight the mechanisms of action that specific long noncoding RNAs employ to regulate T‐lymphocyte function, both in vitro and in vivo.
