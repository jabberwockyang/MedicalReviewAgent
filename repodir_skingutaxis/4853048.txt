Chemokine network is central to the innate and adaptive immunity and entails a variety of proteins and membrane receptors that control physiological processes such as wound healing, angiogenesis, embryo growth and development. During early pregnancy, the chemokine network coordinates not only the recruitment of different leukocyte populations to generate the maternal-placental interface, but also constitutes an additional checkpoint for tissue homeostasis maintenance. The normal switch from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory predominant microenvironment characteristic of the post-implantation stage requires redundant immune tolerance circuits triggered by key master regulators. In this review we will focus on the recruitment and conditioning of maternal immune cells to the uterus at the early implantation period with special interest on high plasticity macrophages and dendritic cells and their ability to induce regulatory T cells. We will also point to putative immunomodulatory polypeptides involved in immune homeostasis maintenance at the maternal-placental interface.
