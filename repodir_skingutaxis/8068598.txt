Pathogen-specific immunity evolves in the context of the infected tissue. However, current immune correlates analyses and vaccine efficacy metrics are based on immune functions from peripheral cells. Less is known about tissue-resident mechanisms of immunity. While antibodies represent the primary correlate of immunity following most clinically approved vaccines, how antibodies interact with localized, compartment-specific immune functions to fight infections, remains unclear. Emerging data demonstrate a unique community of immune cells that reside within different tissues. These tissue-specific immunological communities enable antibodies to direct both expected and unexpected local attack strategies to control, disrupt, and eliminate infection in a tissue-specific manner. Defining the full breadth of antibody effector functions, how they selectively contribute to control at the site of infection may provide clues for the design of next-generation vaccines able to direct the control, elimination, and prevention of compartment specific diseases of both infectious and non-infectious etiologies.
