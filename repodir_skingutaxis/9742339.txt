The release of cytokines from epithelial and stromal cells is critical for the initiation and maintenance of tissue immunity. Three such cytokines, TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25, are important regulators of type 2 immune responses triggered by parasitic worms and allergens. In particular, these cytokines activate group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), Th2 cells, and myeloid cells that drive hallmarks of type 2 immunity. However, emerging data indicates that these tissue-associated cytokines are not only involved in canonical type 2 responses, but are also important in the context of viral infections, cancer, and even homeostasis. Here we provide a brief review of the roles of TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25 in diverse immune contexts, while highlighting their relative contributions in tissue-specific responses. We also emphasize a biologically-motivated framework for thinking about the integration of multiple immune signals, including the three featured in this review.
