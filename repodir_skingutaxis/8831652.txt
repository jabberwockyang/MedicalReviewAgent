Microphysiological systems (MPS) or tissue chips/organs-on-chips (OoCs) are novel in vitro models that emulate human physiology at the most basic functional level. In this review, we discuss various hurdles to widespread adoption of MPS technology focusing on issues from multiple stakeholder sectors â€“ e.g., academic MPS developers, commercial suppliers of platforms, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and regulatory organizations. Broad adoption of MPS technology has thus far been limited by a gap in translation between platform developers, end-users, regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. In this brief review we offer a perspective on the existing barriers and how end-users may help surmount these obstacles to achieve broader adoption of MPS technology.
