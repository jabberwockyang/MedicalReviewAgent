Leukocyte adhesion deficiency Type I (LAD-I), a disease syndrome associated with frequent microbial infections, is caused by mutations on the CD18 subunit of β2 integrins. LAD-I is invariably associated with severe periodontal bone loss, historically attributed to lack of neutrophil surveillance of the periodontal infection. Here, we challenge this dogma by showing that the cytokine IL-17 plays a major role in the oral pathology of LAD-I. Defective neutrophil recruitment in LAD-I patients, or in LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18)-deficient mice that exhibit the LAD-I periodontal phenotype, was associated with excessive production of predominantly T cell-derived IL-17 in the periodontal tissue. The pathological elevation of IL-17 in the LFA-1–deficient periodontal tissue derived also from innate lymphoid cells. Strikingly, local treatment with anti-IL-17 (or anti-IL-23) in LFA-1-deficient mice not only blocked inflammatory periodontal bone loss but also caused a reduction in the total bacterial burden, suggesting that the IL-17-driven pathogenesis of LAD-I periodontitis leads to dysbiosis. Our findings therefore support an IL-17-targeted therapy for this condition.
