Chemokines, acting on their cognate receptors on infiltrating leukocytes, drive the inflammatory response. We have been interested in determining roles and potential mechanisms for the atypical chemokine-scavenging receptor D6 in the regulation of inflammation. Here we show that a ‘psoriasis-like’ pathology that arises in inflamed skins of D6 deficient mice, is characterised by a massive and aberrant localisation of neutrophils to the dermal/epidermal junction which is associated with development of the pathology. Such misplacement of neutrophils is also seen with D6 deficient mice in other inflammatory models suggesting a role for D6 in the spatial positioning of neutrophils within inflamed sites. We further show that D6 functions cell-autonomously in this context and that D6, expressed by neutrophils, limits their migrational responses to CCR1 ligands such as CCL3. Our data therefore indicate that D6 is able to play a cell-autonomous role as a migratory ‘rheostat’ restricting migration of D6-expressing cells such as neutrophils towards ligands for co-expressed inflammatory chemokine receptors. These data have important implications for our understanding of the roles for D6 in regulating inflammation and for our understanding of the control of spatial positioning of leukocytes at inflamed sites.
