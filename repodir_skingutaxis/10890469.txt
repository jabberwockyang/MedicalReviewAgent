The human body is inhabited by trillions of microorganisms that collectively form what is known as the microbiome [1,2,3]. This intricate ecosystem consists of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes that reside on various surfaces, such as the skin, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive organs [1,2,3] (see Table 1). Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of the microbiome in human health and disease [1,2,3]. One area that has garnered significant attention is the impact of the microbiome on infectious diseases.

Infectious diseases remain a major global health challenge, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditionally, these diseases have been attributed solely to pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, emerging research has revealed that the microbiome plays a crucial role in shaping host susceptibility to infections and influencing disease outcomes [4,5]. The microbiome interacts with pathogens directly or indirectly through various mechanisms, including competition for resources, production of antimicrobial substances, modulation of immune responses, and alteration in the local microenvironment [6].

Understanding how the microbiome influences infectious diseases is not only important for unraveling the complex interplay between microbes and their hosts but also holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which the microbiome affects pathogenesis, we can identify potential targets for intervention and formulate innovative treatment approaches [7]. Furthermore, the composition of the microbiome can serve as a diagnostic tool for predicting disease susceptibility, monitoring disease progression, and assessing treatment efficacy.jpm-14-00217-t001_Table 1Table 1Microbiota composition and potential impacts on health in different body sites.Body SiteDominant PhylaKey Bacterial GeneraFunctionsPotential Impacts on HealthReferencesGutBacteroidetes, FirmicutesBacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, LactobacillusDigestion of dietary fibers, nutrient absorption, vitamin synthesis, immune system modulationObesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer[8,9]Oral CavityFirmicutes, BacteroidetesStreptococcus, Actinomyces, Prevotella, PorphyromonasBreakdown of dietary carbohydrates, fermentation, barrier against pathogensDental caries, periodontal disease, halitosis[10]SkinActinobacteria, Firmicutes, ProteobacteriaStaphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, CutibacteriumSebum production, sweat decomposition, barrier against pathogensAcne, eczema, psoriasis, wound healing[11]VaginaFirmicutes, BacteroidetesLactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Gardnerella, PrevotellaMaintain optimal pH balance, prevent colonization by pathogensBacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, preterm birth[12,13]Respiratory TractFirmicutes, BacteroidetesStreptococcus, Haemophilus, Staphylococcus, PrevotellaGas exchange, immune system modulation, barrier against pathogensPneumonia, asthma, cystic fibro[14,15]

The objectives of this review are to comprehensively explore the current understanding of the role of the microbiome in infectious disease pathogenesis and to highlight potential treatment strategies that target the microbiome. Specifically, we will examine recent findings on how alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome contribute to the development and progression of infectious diseases. Additionally, we will discuss various approaches aimed at modulating the microbiome to prevent or treat infections, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and targeted antimicrobial therapies.

By synthesizing existing knowledge and discussing recent advancements in the field, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the importance of the microbiome in infectious diseases. By shedding light on the intricate relationship between microbes and their hosts, we stimulate further research in this area and contribute to the development of effective strategies for preventing and treating infectious diseases. Understanding the role of the microbiome in infectious diseases has the potential to revolutionize our approach to healthcare and significantly improve patient outcomes in the future.

The human microbiome, comprising trillions of microbes residing in and on our bodies, plays a crucial role in maintaining our health. The complex microbiota community interacts with our immune system and influences various physiological processes, including digestion, metabolism, and protection against pathogens [2,3,16,17]. When this delicate balance is disrupted, a condition known as dysbiosis occurs. Dysbiosis is characterized by imbalances in the microbiome and has been implicated in the development and progression of various infectious diseases. Dysbiosis has been associated with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, metabolic syndrome, allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and mental health disorders [18,19].

Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. While it is well established that these pathogens directly contribute to the development of infectious diseases, emerging evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the microbiome can also play a significant role. Dysbiosis can alter the composition and function of the microbiota, leading to a compromised immune response and increased susceptibility to infection [20]. Several infectious diseases have been associated with microbiome dysbiosis. One such example is Clostridioides (C) difficile infection (CDI), a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by severe diarrhea. CDI commonly occurs following antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the normal gut microbiota and allows C. difficile to overgrow [21,22]. Studies have shown that individuals with a healthy and diverse microbiome are less susceptible to CDI compared with those with dysbiosis.

In addition to CDI, respiratory tract infections have also been linked to microbiome dysbiosis. Research indicates that alterations in the lung microbiota can predispose individuals to respiratory infections such as pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dysbiosis in the lung microbiota can weaken the respiratory defense mechanisms, making individuals more susceptible to pathogen colonization and infection [23,24].

Furthermore, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have also been associated with microbiome dysbiosis. For instance, bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection, is characterized by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria and a decrease in beneficial lactobacilli [25]. This dysbiosis disrupts the vaginal ecosystem and increases the risk of acquiring STIs such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae [26].

Gastrointestinal infections, such as Helicobacter pylori infection and foodborne illnesses, have also been linked to dysbiosis [27,28,29]. H. pylori is a bacterium that colonizes the stomach and is associated with various gastrointestinal disorders, including gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Dysbiosis of the gastric microbiome can influence H. pylori colonization and disease progression [30,31].

Moreover, dysbiosis has been implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. These chronic conditions are characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and are believed to result from an abnormal immune response triggered by dysbiosis [18,32]. Imbalances in the gut microbiota composition have been observed in individuals with IBD, suggesting a potential role for dysbiosis in disease pathogenesis.

Emerging evidence also suggests a link between dysbiosis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The urinary tract is normally sterile; however, certain bacteria can disrupt this balance and cause UTIs. Dysbiosis of the urogenital microbiota may contribute to UTI susceptibility by altering the protective mechanisms that prevent bacterial colonization.

Furthermore, skin infections have also been associated with microbiome dysbiosis. Conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis, and wound infections have been linked to alterations in the skin microbiota composition [33,34,35]. Dysbiosis of the skin microbiome can disrupt the natural defense mechanisms of the skin, allowing pathogens to colonize and cause infections [36].

Additionally, dysbiosis has been implicated in the development of oral infections such as dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal diseases. The oral cavity harbors a diverse microbial community that helps maintain oral health [37]. Imbalances in this community can lead to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria, contributing to the development of oral infections.

Furthermore, dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and other pregnancy complications. Imbalances in vaginal microbial composition can lead to inflammation and an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, disrupting the delicate environment required for a healthy pregnancy [38,39,40].

The microbiome, which consists of various bacteria, fungi, and viruses residing within and on our bodies, plays a crucial role in the development of infectious diseases [41]. This influence is exerted through a complex interplay of mechanisms. Firstly, the microbiome competes directly with pathogens for nutrients and space, effectively creating a barrier to infection. For instance, lactobacilli in the female genital tract produce lactic acid, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic yeasts and bacteria [42]. Similarly, gut bacteria metabolize dietary fibers to produce short-chain fatty acids, which nourish colonocytes and create an unfavorable environment for many pathogens. However, disturbances in the microbial ecosystem can facilitate pathogen invasion [43,44].

Secondly, the microbiome modulates host immune responses, either protecting against or promoting infectious diseases. Commensal microbes prime the immune system, promoting immune cell maturation, antimicrobial peptide production, and inflammation regulation [45,46]. For example, segmented filamentous bacteria in the gut stimulate the production of Th17 cells, which protect against bacterial and fungal infections [47,48,49]. On the other hand, some commensal bacteria downregulate immune responses or induce tolerance to prevent overreaction to harmless antigens, creating opportunities for pathogens to establish infections [50,51].

Additionally, commensal microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that inhibit or kill potential pathogens. These compounds include bacteriocins and substances like ethanol and acetic acid [52,53,54]. The microbiome’s production of these compounds contributes to colonization resistance, preventing opportunistic pathogens from gaining a foothold. However, antibiotic treatment that reduces beneficial microbes can diminish this protective effect [55,56].

The microbiome also influences the integrity of mucosal barriers, preventing pathogen invasion. Interactions between commensal microbes and host epithelial cells affect cell turnover, repair, and the production of mucus and tight junction proteins that maintain barrier function [57,58]. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to increased intestinal permeability, allowing pathogens easier access to tissues and contributing to inflammation and infection.

Furthermore, the microbiome indirectly affects pathogenesis by influencing other members of the microbial community. Commensal bacteria can alter local pH levels, produce metabolic byproducts that influence neighboring microbes’ growth and virulence factor expression, interfere with quorum sensing, or degrade virulence factors produced by pathogens [59,60,61]. The balance and composition of the microbiome are critical in determining whether pathogenic microbes can thrive and cause disease.

In addition to these mechanisms, the microbiome’s impact extends to microbial metabolites and host signaling pathways. Microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids generated by gut bacteria can modulate immune responses and enhance gut barrier integrity [2,3,62,63,64]. Dysregulation of these metabolic pathways due to changes in the microbiome composition may increase the risk of infection [64,65].

The presence of certain microbiota can also influence pathogen virulence by suppressing gene expression or interfering with their ability to invade host tissues. Some commensal bacteria can sequester limiting nutrients like iron, reducing its availability to pathogens and limiting their growth [66,67,68]. Moreover, the microbiome can induce the expression of host-derived antimicrobial proteins that target specific aspects of pathogen physiology.

The microbiome can impact antibiotic efficacy and resistance as well. The microbiome can impact antibiotic efficacy by metabolizing antibiotics, disrupting the microbial balance, and promoting biofilm formation [69]. The diverse microbial community in our bodies can harbor genes that confer resistance to antibiotics. These genes can be transferred among bacteria through horizontal gene transfer, potentially leading to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant infections [70,71]. Additionally, antibiotics can have broad impacts on the microbiome, targeting not only the causative agent but also commensal organisms. Antibiotics disrupt the healthy balance of gut flora, leading to a reduction in diversity and changes in both populations and functions [72,73]. This disruption can also contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota can persist for extended periods, even after the cessation of antibiotic use [72,73]. This collateral damage can lead to dysbiosis and the overgrowth of resistant pathogens.

Furthermore, the microbiome is involved in drug metabolism and can affect the pharmacokinetics of medications used to treat infections [74,75]. Microbial enzymes within the gut can activate or inactivate drugs, altering their effectiveness, affecting their absorption and distribution, and potentially interacting with other medications and toxicity profiles [76,77,78]. Optimal dosing and drug delivery strategies need to consider these interactions.

The microbiome also influences an individual’s susceptibility to infections through chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity, and IBD [79]. The human microbiome, particularly in the gut, plays a crucial role in protecting against infections and chronic inflammatory diseases by interacting with and regulating the immune system response. However, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to impaired immune function and the development of conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These conditions, in turn, can further impact the health of the microbiome [80,81]. Changes in microbiome composition and function associated with these conditions can impair immune responses and mucosal barrier functions, potentially increasing vulnerability to pathogens.

In addition, the microbiome impacts host epigenetic regulation, modifying gene expression patterns without altering DNA sequences. Microbial metabolites and components can influence enzymes involved in DNA methylation and histone modification, altering gene expression profiles in host cells [1,82,83,84,85,86]. These epigenetic changes affect immune responses, inflammation, and susceptibility to infectious diseases.

The microbiome has a significant impact on the transmission and dissemination of infectious agents and antibiotic resistance genes by influencing competition with pathogens, modulating immune responses, enhancing barrier function, metabolizing nutrients, and training the immune system [87,88,89,90]. Pathogens can exploit the microbial community as a reservoir and means of transmission. For example, some bacteria can form biofilms within the microbiota, providing protection and a means of spreading to other individuals. Furthermore, the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between commensal bacteria and pathogens can occur, contributing to the spread of drug-resistant infections [91,92]. Understanding these transmission dynamics is crucial for implementing effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

The composition and diversity of the microbiome can influence the efficacy of vaccines [93,94]. The diversity of the human microbiome is influenced by a wide range of factors, including age, sex, diet, physical activity, stress, host genetics, diseases, breastfeeding status, lifestyle, delivery mode, geographical and racial variations, temperature, medications, diseases, and bacteriophage [2,95,96,97,98,99,100]. Microbial diversity within the microbiome varies across different body sites and depends on external and internal factors [101,102,103,104]. Commensal microorganisms can interact with the immune system and influence its response to vaccination [105,106]. They can modulate the maturation and activation of immune cells, promote antibody production, and influence the development of immunological memory. Alterations in the microbiome composition, such as those induced by antibiotic use or dysbiosis, may affect vaccine responses and compromise their effectiveness [107,108,109]. Understanding how the microbiome influences vaccine efficacy can inform strategies to optimize immunization protocols and improve protection against infectious diseases.

The microbiome plays a crucial role in host metabolism and nutrient availability, indirectly influencing infectious disease pathogenesis. The gut microbiota community is involved in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, including vitamins and minerals essential for immune function [110]. Disruptions in the microbiome can lead to malabsorption or altered nutrient availability, impacting host health and immune responses. Furthermore, changes in microbial metabolism can produce metabolites that affect systemic processes such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. These alterations can influence an individual’s susceptibility to infections and their ability to mount effective immune responses.

Early-life exposures and interactions with the microbiome can have long-lasting effects on host health and disease susceptibility. The establishment of a healthy microbiome during infancy is critical for immune system development and maturation [111,112]. Perturbations in early microbial colonization, such as through cesarean section delivery or formula feeding, have been associated with an increased risk of developing infections later in life [113]. The microbiome can also influence the development of immune tolerance and allergic sensitization [114]. Understanding the role of early-life microbial exposures in shaping host susceptibility to infectious diseases can inform interventions aimed at optimizing microbiome development and reducing disease burden.

The microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses in the host. Commensal microorganisms help maintain a state of immune homeostasis by promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [115,116]. This balance is essential for preventing excessive inflammation, which can contribute to tissue damage and promote the growth and spread of pathogens. Dysbiosis disrupts this delicate equilibrium, leading to chronic inflammation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.

Commensal microorganisms communicate with host cells through various signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes and immune cell development. Microbial metabolites and cell surface molecules can bind to specific receptors on host cells, triggering signaling cascades that affect cellular functions. These interactions can impact the differentiation and maturation of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, thus influencing the overall immune response to infection [117,118,119]. Disruptions in these interactions, such as alterations in the microbiome composition or the loss of specific commensal species, can lead to immune dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases.

Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, known as the gut–brain axis. The microbiome can influence brain function and behavior through various mechanisms, including the production of neurotransmitters and metabolites that can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). This intricate connection has implications for infectious diseases, as alterations in the gut microbiome composition may influence host responses to pathogens via neuroimmune interactions [120,121]. Moreover, stress-induced changes in the gut microbiota can impact immune responses and increase susceptibility to infections, highlighting the role of the gut–brain axis in infectious disease pathogenesis [122,123,124]. Additionally, the microbiome has been found to influence infectious diseases involving the BBB through mechanisms such as metabolite production and immune system modulation. Certain bacteria-produced metabolites, like short-chain fatty acids, can affect BBB integrity and permeability [125]. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota can also impact immune responses within the CNS, making the BBB more susceptible to pathogen invasion [126,127]. Targeting the microbiome through interventions like probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation shows promise for restoring BBB integrity and enhancing immune defenses. Understanding specific microbial interactions with BBB receptors may lead to targeted therapies for infectious diseases involving the BBB.

The microbiome and host metabolism have a mutually beneficial relationship. Commensal microorganisms contribute to host metabolism by assisting in the digestion and fermentation of complex dietary components such as fiber, producing metabolites that can be utilized by both the host and other members of the microbiome [128,129]. In turn, these microbial metabolic activities influence host metabolic pathways, including energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis [110,129]. Dysbiosis or alterations in dietary patterns can disrupt these metabolic interactions, potentially impacting host immune function and susceptibility to infections.

Host genetic factors play a role in shaping the composition and function of the microbiome, which can subsequently influence infectious disease pathogenesis [130,131]. Genetic variations can affect host–microbe interactions by influencing immune responses, mucosal barrier integrity, and susceptibility to dysbiosis [132]. Host genetic factors also impact the ability of commensal microorganisms to colonize specific niches within the body or produce antimicrobial substances that can inhibit pathogens [133,134]. Understanding the interplay between host genetics and the microbiome is crucial for unraveling individual variations in infection susceptibility and developing personalized approaches to prevent and treat infectious diseases.

The microbiome plays a crucial role in the development and function of mucosal immunity, particularly at sites such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Commensal microorganisms contribute to the maturation and activation of immune cells within these mucosal tissues, including specialized cells such as M cells and secretory IgA-producing plasma cells [135,136]. These immune cells help defend against pathogens and maintain immune homeostasis. Disruptions in the microbiome can impair the development and function of mucosal immunity, leading to increased susceptibility to infections at these sites.

The microbiome engages in nutrient competition with pathogens, limiting the availability of essential nutrients required for pathogen growth and survival. Commensal microorganisms can outcompete pathogens for nutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamins, thereby reducing their ability to establish infections [59,137]. For example, lactobacilli in the vaginal microbiota produce bacteriocins that can chelate iron, limiting its availability to pathogens [138]. These nutrient competition mechanisms contribute to colonization resistance and help protect against pathogen invasion and overgrowth.

The microbiome can influence host tissue repair and regeneration processes, which are essential for resolving infections and restoring tissue integrity. Commensal microorganisms can interact with host cells to promote wound healing, tissue remodeling, and regeneration [139,140]. They can modulate signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production. Disruptions in the microbiome can impair these tissue repair processes, potentially prolonging infection duration or increasing the risk of tissue damage.

While much focus is on bacterial pathogens, the microbiome also influences antiviral immune responses. Commensal microorganisms shape the development and functionality of antiviral immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells, as well as influence the production of interferons and other antiviral molecules [141,142,143]. The presence of a healthy and diverse microbiome can enhance antiviral defenses by promoting immune cell activation and modulating cytokine responses. Moreover, certain commensal bacteria have been found to directly inhibit viral replication through the production of antiviral substances or competition for viral attachment sites [144,145,146,147].

The composition of the microbiome has a significant impact on host barrier permeability, specifically affecting the integrity of epithelial barriers in the gut and respiratory tract. Commensal microorganisms actively promote the expression of tight junction proteins and mucus production, which play a crucial role in maintaining barrier integrity and preventing the penetration of pathogens [148]. However, dysbiosis or alterations in the microbiome composition can compromise the function of these barriers, resulting in increased permeability and facilitating the entry of pathogens into host tissues [65,149]. Consequently, this heightened barrier permeability contributes to the development or worsening of infectious diseases.

The microbiome also exerts influence over host metabolic inflammation, particularly in conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome [150,151]. Dysbiosis observed in these conditions can lead to changes in the production of inflammatory mediators and adipokines, ultimately contributing to a pro-inflammatory state. This chronic, low-grade inflammation can have adverse effects on immune responses and create an environment that is conducive to the growth and persistence of pathogens [152]. Moreover, alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota can affect lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity, further impacting an individual’s susceptibility to infectious diseases [153,154].

Certain changes in the composition of the microbiome have been associated with immunodeficiencies, which can manifest as deficiencies in specific immune cell populations or impaired immune responses [155,156,157]. Disruptions in the gut microbiota, for example, have been linked to reduced numbers of regulatory T cells and impaired T cell function, potentially resulting in increased vulnerability to infections [65,158,159]. Understanding these microbiome-associated immunodeficiencies is crucial for identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of developing infectious diseases and developing targeted interventions to restore immune function.

The microbiome has the ability to influence host stress responses by interacting with the neuroendocrine system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [160,161]. Commensal microorganisms can impact the production and signaling of stress hormones, which ultimately affect immune function and susceptibility to infections [162]. Furthermore, stress-induced alterations in the microbiome can exacerbate these effects, creating a feedback loop that may significantly impact infectious disease pathogenesis [163,164].

Commensal microorganisms are actively involved in breaking down and absorbing dietary components, thereby influencing the availability of metabolites that can impact host physiology and immune function [165,166]. Dysbiosis can lead to changes in metabolite absorption and availability, potentially affecting immune responses and an individual’s susceptibility to infections. For instance, alterations in microbial metabolism can influence the production of metabolites with immunomodulatory properties, thereby influencing host immune regulation and responses to pathogens [117,119].

The microbiome has a significant influence on the production of antimicrobial peptides by host cells, which play a critical role in defending against pathogens. Commensal microorganisms actively stimulate the expression of genes that encode antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing host defenses against infections [167,168,169]. However, dysbiosis can lead to disruptions in antimicrobial peptide production, potentially compromising host immune responses and increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases. Some mechanisms of microbiome-mediated pathogenesis are illustrated in Figure 1.

The impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes in infectious diseases has become a subject of increasing interest in the field of medical research. These microorganisms play a vital role in maintaining the overall health and balance of our body systems, particularly our immune system.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the composition and diversity of the microbiome can significantly influence the effectiveness of treatments for infectious diseases. For example, the use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections can disrupt the balance of the microbiome by eliminating both harmful and beneficial bacteria [170,171]. This disruption can lead to the overgrowth of certain harmful bacteria, such as C. difficile, which can cause severe diarrhea and other complications.

Furthermore, the microbiome has been found to impact the response to antiviral therapies by impacting drug metabolism, immune system activation, drug resistance, inflammation, and offering potential for personalized medicine approaches [172,173,174]. Individuals with a specific composition of gut bacteria may have a higher likelihood of responding positively to antiviral medications for hepatitis B [175,176,177,178,179]. Similarly, the composition of the respiratory tract microbiome has been linked to the severity and duration of respiratory viral infections like influenza [180,181].

The microbiome can influence not only the effectiveness of treatment but also the development of drug resistance in infectious diseases [182]. Certain bacteria within the microbiome have been found to transfer antibiotic resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria, making them more difficult to treat [183,184]. This underscores the importance of understanding the role of the microbiome in treatment outcomes and developing strategies to reduce the emergence of drug resistance.

There is also evidence that influencing the microbiome can improve treatment outcomes for infectious diseases. This can be achieved through various approaches, including probiotics, i.e., live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed (Figure 2). Probiotics have shown promise in restoring microbial balance and improving response to treatment for conditions such as recurrent UTIs and antibiotic-associated diarrhea [185,186,187].

Another crucial aspect of the microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes is its role in modulating host immune responses. The microbiome has been found to interact with the immune system, influencing its development, function, and ability to fight off infections. Imbalances in the microbiome, such as dysbiosis or alterations in microbial diversity, have been associated with an increased susceptibility to infections and a poor response to treatment. Understanding these interactions can help identify novel therapeutic targets to enhance immune responses and improve treatment outcomes [172,188]. Furthermore, the microbiome can influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial drugs [189]. Certain bacteria within the microbiome can metabolize or modify drugs, affecting their efficacy and toxicity. For example, gut bacteria can activate or deactivate specific antibiotics, potentially altering their therapeutic effect [190,191,192]. Additionally, the presence of particular bacteria in the gut can impact the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs, leading to variations in drug concentrations and responses [193,194]. Considering these microbiome–drug interactions can help optimize treatment regimens and minimize adverse effects.

The impact of the microbiome extends beyond bacterial infections and antiviral therapies. It also plays a role in fungal infections and antifungal treatments. The composition of the microbiome has been associated with susceptibility to fungal infections such as candidiasis and aspergillosis [195,196]. Moreover, some studies suggest that certain gut bacteria can enhance the antifungal activity of medications or inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi. These findings highlight the potential for targeting the microbiome as an adjunctive therapy for fungal infections.

Recent studies have emphasized the role of the microbiome in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy in infectious diseases. Immunotherapy is a promising approach that utilizes the body’s immune system to combat infections. However, the efficacy of immunotherapy can vary among individuals, and the microbiome has emerged as a potential contributor to this variability [197]. Certain bacteria within the microbiome have been found to interact with immune cells and influence the response to immunotherapy [198]. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which the microbiome affects immunotherapy outcomes can help optimize treatment strategies and enhance patient outcomes.

Moreover, the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes extends beyond the individual level to population health. The composition of the microbiome can vary among different populations due to factors such as geography, diet, and lifestyle [199]. The impact of meat on the microbiota in a vegan diet is still uncertain, as factors such as origin, sex, age, and pre-existing illnesses contribute to the observed differences in the gut microbiota of long-term vegetarians and vegans compared with omnivores [182]. While interpersonal variability in enterotype composition has shown no significant effect of diet on the microbiota, extreme diets can cause temporary changes. High-fiber plant-based diets, including vegetarian, vegan, and Mediterranean diets, have been shown to have positive effects on health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria like Rominococcus bromii and reducing the Frimicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio [200,201,202,203]. However, different diets have varying impacts on the microbiome. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets, for example, significantly alter gut microbiota composition by promoting the growth of leanness-associated bacteria [204]. These variations can contribute to differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases and responses to treatments. By studying the microbiome at the population level, we can gain insights into the factors that influence treatment outcomes and develop targeted interventions to improve public health measures against infectious diseases.

One area of interest in studying the microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes is antibiotic stewardship. Understanding the role of the microbiome in treatment outcomes can provide insights into strategies for optimizing antibiotic use [72,205]. By considering an individual’s microbiome composition, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions about selecting the most appropriate antibiotics, dosages, and treatment durations. This personalized approach can help minimize disruptions to the microbiome and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, such as the development of antibiotic-resistant infections.

Furthermore, the microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes extends beyond direct antimicrobial therapies to include the effectiveness of other therapeutic modalities, such as vaccines [206,207,208]. The presence of specific microbes in the gut can shape immune responses to vaccines [208], affecting their efficacy. By understanding these interactions, we can explore strategies to modulate the microbiome to enhance vaccine responses, potentially leading to improved protection against infectious diseases.

The microbiome has been implicated in the development of immune-related disorders and autoimmune diseases. Disruptions in the microbiome can lead to dysregulation of immune responses, resulting in chronic inflammation and increased susceptibility to infections [65]. Understanding the intricate interactions between the microbiome and the immune system can provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches. For example, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which involves transferring healthy microbiota from a donor to a recipient, has shown promise in treating certain infections and immune-related conditions [209,210]. By restoring microbial balance, FMT can help modulate immune responses and improve treatment outcomes.

Moreover, the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes is not limited to individual patients. It also has implications for public health and infection control practices. The composition of the microbiome can influence the transmission and spread of infectious diseases within communities. For instance, certain strains of bacteria within the microbiome may enhance or inhibit the colonization and transmission of pathogens [211,212]. Understanding these dynamics can inform infection prevention strategies, such as the use of probiotics or targeted hygiene practices, to reduce the risk of disease transmission [89,213]. Additionally, studying the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes at a population level can help identify patterns and trends that guide public health interventions and resource allocation.

Recent technological advances have allowed for more comprehensive and precise analysis of the microbiome, leading to a deeper understanding of its impact on treatment outcomes in infectious diseases. High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as metagenomics, have enabled researchers to identify and characterize the vast array of microorganisms present in the human microbiome [214]. This has provided valuable insights into the microbial communities associated with different infectious diseases and their responses to treatment. Additionally, advancements in bioinformatics and computational tools have facilitated the analysis of large-scale microbiome datasets, allowing researchers to identify microbial signatures associated with treatment outcomes [215,216]. These technological advancements have accelerated our understanding of the microbiome’s role in infectious diseases and opened up new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.

Furthermore, the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes extends beyond infectious diseases alone. It also affects other areas of medicine, including cancer therapy. The microbiome has been implicated in modulating responses to cancer immunotherapy, influencing both treatment efficacy and toxicity. Specific gut bacteria have been associated with improved or reduced responses to immunotherapy drugs, highlighting the potential for manipulating the microbiome to enhance treatment outcomes in cancer patients [217,218]. This emerging field of research, known as microbial oncology, holds promise for revolutionizing cancer treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes [219,220,221].

One area of growing interest in this field is the development of microbiome-based therapeutics. Researchers are exploring the potential of utilizing specific microorganisms or their byproducts to target and treat infectious diseases. For example, certain beneficial bacteria found in the microbiome have been identified for their ability to produce antimicrobial substances that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria [222]. These antimicrobial-producing bacteria, known as probiotics, have shown promise in preventing or treating various infections [223]. Additionally, microbial-derived molecules, such as bacteriocins or phages, are being investigated as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. These microbiome-based therapeutics hold potential for providing targeted and tailored treatment options that minimize disruption to the overall microbiome while effectively combating infectious diseases.

Another area of research focus is understanding the impact of lifestyle factors on the microbiome and subsequent treatment outcomes in infectious diseases. It is now recognized that these lifestyle factors can affect an individual’s susceptibility to infections and response to treatments [224]. For instance, studies have linked a high-fiber diet to a more diverse and beneficial microbiome, which may enhance immune response and improve treatment outcomes [225,226]. Recognizing the role of lifestyle factors in shaping the microbiome opens up opportunities for interventions such as dietary modifications or stress reduction techniques that can complement traditional treatments and improve patient outcomes.

The study of the microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes has revealed important insights into the concept of the “pathobiome”. This refers to the specific microbiome signatures associated with different diseases, allowing for targeted interventions and personalized treatment approaches. Researchers have identified distinct microbial communities linked to respiratory tract infections, UTIs, and skin infections [227,228]. Understanding these pathobiomes can guide therapeutic strategies by targeting specific microorganisms or manipulating the overall microbial composition to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes.

Furthermore, the microbiome’s influence on treatment outcomes extends beyond infectious diseases to secondary health complications. Disruptions in the gut microbiome have been linked to an increased risk of developing conditions such as IBD, metabolic disorders, and mental health disorders [229,230]. These secondary health complications can further influence treatment outcomes for infectious diseases. Therefore, addressing the role of the microbiome in these comorbidities is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of treatment outcomes and developing holistic therapeutic approaches that consider the interplay between the microbiome and broader health conditions.

Moreover, the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes extends to chronic infectious diseases that require long-term management. In conditions such as HIV, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis, the microbiome has been found to influence disease progression, treatment response, and complications [231]. For instance, in individuals with HIV, the gut microbiome has been associated with immune activation and inflammation, impacting disease severity and response to antiretroviral therapy [232,233]. Similarly, in hepatitis C infection, the composition of the gut microbiome has been linked to treatment outcomes and liver disease progression. Understanding these interactions can inform personalized approaches to managing chronic infectious diseases and improving long-term treatment outcomes.

The microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes is not limited to internal infections but also extends to skin microbiota and treatment outcomes in dermatological infectious conditions. The skin microbiome, which consists of a diverse community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in maintaining skin health and protecting against infections. Disruptions in the skin microbiome have been associated with various dermatological infections such as acne, eczema, and fungal skin infections [234,235,236]. Understanding how the skin microbiome influences treatment outcomes can guide the development of targeted therapies that restore microbial balance and improve skin health [237,238]. Furthermore, considering the interplay between the skin microbiome and topical treatments can lead to more effective and personalized approaches for managing infectious skin conditions.

Additionally, the microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes is relevant in the context of hospital-acquired infections. Factors such as antibiotic use, invasive procedures, and prolonged hospital stays can disrupt the microbiome of hospitalized patients, leading to imbalances and increased susceptibility to infections [239]. Understanding how these perturbations affect treatment outcomes is crucial for improving patient safety and reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections [240]. Strategies aimed at preserving the microbiome during hospitalization, such as targeted antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention measures, can help mitigate the impact on treatment outcomes and reduce the burden of healthcare-associated infections.

The influence of the microbiome on treatment outcomes also extends to the pediatric population. The establishment of the infant microbiome during birth and early infancy has been linked to long-term health outcomes, including immune system development and disease susceptibility [241,242,243]. Disruptions in the early-life microbiome have been associated with an increased risk of infections and immune-related disorders in children. Understanding how early microbiome development influences treatment outcomes is essential for developing interventions that support healthy microbial colonization and improve resistance to infections in pediatric patients.

Moreover, the microbiome’s impact on treatment outcomes extends to antimicrobial resistance. Studies have shown that alterations in the composition and diversity of the microbiome can influence the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance [244,245]. Certain bacteria within the microbiome can harbor resistance genes and transfer them to pathogenic bacteria, contributing to the development of resistance [246]. Understanding how the microbiome influences antimicrobial resistance is essential for developing strategies to mitigate its impact. Interventions aimed at preserving microbial balance and minimizing disruptions to the microbiome during antibiotic treatments may help reduce the risk of promoting antimicrobial resistance.

In addition, the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes has implications for global health and infectious disease management in resource-limited settings. The composition and diversity of the microbiome can vary across different populations and geographic regions, influencing susceptibility to infections and treatment responses [247,248]. Recognizing these variations is crucial for developing tailored interventions that account for the unique microbiome profiles of diverse populations. Furthermore, understanding the impact of the microbiome on treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings can guide the development of cost-effective and sustainable strategies for managing infectious diseases in these contexts.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the important role that the microbiome plays in maintaining our overall health [2]. The microbiome, which refers to the collection of microorganisms that inhabit our bodies, not only aids in digestion but also affects our immune system and protects us against infectious diseases. As we delve deeper into understanding the intricacies of the microbiome, researchers have begun to explore innovative treatment strategies that target these microbial communities to combat infectious diseases (Figure 3). One such strategy is the use of probiotics, which are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotics have shown promise in preventing and treating various infectious diseases by restoring the balance of beneficial bacteria in the microbiome. For example, studies have demonstrated that certain strains of probiotics can reduce the duration and severity of gastrointestinal infections caused by pathogens such as C. difficile and Salmonella [213,249].

Another innovative approach involves the use of FMT, a procedure where fecal matter from a healthy donor is transferred to a recipient with a disrupted microbiome. FMT has gained recognition as an effective treatment for recurrent C. difficile infection, with success rates exceeding 90%. This approach aims to restore a diverse and healthy microbiome in the recipient, thereby outcompeting and eliminating harmful pathogens [250,251].

Furthermore, researchers are investigating the potential of using phage therapy to target specific pathogenic bacteria within the microbiome. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacteria, making them an attractive alternative to antibiotics [252,253]. By selectively targeting harmful bacteria while preserving beneficial ones, phage therapy has the potential to treat infectious diseases without disrupting the delicate balance of the microbiome.

An advance in sequencing technologies has allowed researchers to identify and characterize specific microbial signatures associated with different infectious diseases [254,255]. This knowledge opens up the possibility of developing personalized treatments that target the unique microbiota composition of each patient. By tailoring interventions to individual microbiomes, treatment efficacy could be significantly improved.

In addition to the aforementioned treatment strategies, researchers are also exploring the potential of microbiome-modulating drugs to combat infectious diseases [76,256]. These drugs aim to directly manipulate the composition and function of the microbiome to promote a healthy microbial community. For instance, small molecules known as postbiotics have emerged as a promising approach. Postbiotics are metabolic byproducts of probiotic bacteria that exhibit beneficial effects on the host [257,258,259]. They can modulate immune responses, enhance barrier function, and inhibit the growth of pathogens, making them attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions.

Furthermore, innovative technologies such as synthetic biology and genetic engineering are being utilized to engineer the microbiome for targeted disease treatment. Researchers are developing genetically modified probiotic bacteria that can produce specific antimicrobial peptides or molecules that enhance host immune responses [260,261]. These engineered probiotics have the potential to provide a more targeted and effective approach to combating infectious diseases by leveraging the natural abilities of these microorganisms.

Another area of active research is the investigation of the crosstalk between the microbiome and the immune system [262]. The microbiome has been shown to influence immune responses, and dysbiosis (an imbalance in the microbiome) has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections [90]. By understanding the intricate interactions between the microbiome and the immune system, researchers can develop novel strategies that modulate immune responses to enhance the body’s ability to fight off pathogens. Additionally, innovative diagnostic tools are being developed to assess the composition and function of the microbiome in real time. These tools, such as metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics, provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the microbiome during infectious diseases. By monitoring changes in the microbiome, clinicians can tailor treatment strategies and track the effectiveness of interventions, leading to more personalized and precise approaches to combating infectious diseases.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential of bacteriophage therapy as an innovative treatment strategy to combat infectious diseases [263,264]. Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that specifically target and infect bacteria. They have the ability to replicate within bacterial cells and ultimately cause their destruction. This targeted approach offers a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics, which can have broad-spectrum effects and lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.

Phage therapy involves the isolation and purification of specific phages that are known to target and kill the pathogenic bacteria causing the infection [265,266]. These phages are then administered to the patient, either orally, topically, or intravenously. The phages selectively replicate within the target bacteria, leading to their lysis and subsequent elimination from the body [267,268]. This approach has shown promising results in the treatment of various infectious diseases, including respiratory infections, UTIs, and skin infections.

Furthermore, researchers are exploring the potential of using engineered phages to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. By genetically modifying phages, scientists can improve their ability to recognize and infect specific bacterial strains, increasing their specificity and effectiveness. Additionally, engineered phages can be modified to carry payloads such as antimicrobial peptides or genes that encode antimicrobial substances, further enhancing their killing capacity.

Another innovative approach involves the use of microbiome-based therapeutics to target infectious diseases. The microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms that inhabit various regions of our body, including the skin, gut, and respiratory tract. These microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining health and preventing infections. Researchers are investigating the use of microbiome-based interventions, such as prebiotics and postbiotics, to promote a healthy microbiome and enhance the body’s natural defense mechanisms against pathogens [269,270].

Prebiotics are substances that selectively promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. By providing a favorable environment for these beneficial bacteria to thrive, prebiotics can help restore microbial balance and strengthen the immune system [271,272,273]. Postbiotics, on the other hand, are the metabolic byproducts of beneficial bacteria that exhibit various health-promoting effects. These include antimicrobial activity against pathogens, modulation of immune responses, and enhancement of gut barrier function [274,275,276].

One approach is the use of nanotechnology to deliver antimicrobial agents directly to the site of infection [277,278,279]. Nano-sized particles can be engineered to encapsulate antimicrobial compounds and selectively target specific pathogens within the microbiome [280,281]. These nanoparticles can be designed to release the antimicrobial agents in a controlled manner, maximizing their effectiveness while minimizing off-target effects. This targeted delivery system holds great potential for enhancing the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments and reducing the development of resistance [280,282].

Another emerging strategy involves the modulation of the gut–brain axis to influence the microbiome and combat infectious diseases [283]. The gut–brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, mediated by neural, endocrine, and immune pathways [284]. Studies have shown that disruptions in this axis can affect the composition and function of the microbiome, leading to increased susceptibility to infections [283]. By targeting the gut–brain axis through interventions such as dietary modifications, stress reduction techniques, or even neurostimulation, researchers aim to restore a healthy microbiome and enhance the body’s ability to fight off pathogens.

Furthermore, advancements in bioinformatics and computational modeling are playing a crucial role in understanding the complex interactions within the microbiome and guiding treatment strategies [285,286]. By analyzing large datasets of microbial genomic information, researchers can identify key microbial signatures associated with specific infections or disease states. This knowledge can then be used to develop predictive models that help predict disease progression, treatment response, and potential therapeutic targets within the microbiome.

Additionally, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of microbiome transplantation from healthy individuals as a treatment strategy for infectious diseases. Similar to FMT, this approach involves transferring a diverse range of beneficial microorganisms from a healthy donor to an infected individual. By replenishing the microbial community with diverse and functional bacteria, this therapy aims to restore microbial balance and enhance the immune response against pathogens.

One emerging area of research is the development of microbiome-based vaccines. Traditional vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and mount a response against specific pathogens. Microbiome-based vaccines take advantage of the interactions between the microbiome and the immune system to develop novel vaccination approaches [287]. By targeting specific components of the microbiome that play a role in immune modulation, we aim to elicit a strong and protective immune response against pathogens [80,90]. These vaccines have the potential to provide long-lasting protection against infectious diseases while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.

Another approach involves the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from the microbiome [288,289]. AMPs are small proteins produced by various organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and even our own cells [290]. They possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and can effectively kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens. Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic or naturally occurring AMPs as therapeutics to combat infectious diseases [291]. These peptides can be administered topically, orally, or through targeted delivery systems to specifically target the site of infection while minimizing damage to beneficial microbes [291,292].

Furthermore, there is a growing interest in utilizing microbiome-targeted therapies in combination with traditional antibiotics. Antibiotics are essential for treating many infectious diseases; however, their broad-spectrum nature can disrupt the delicate balance of the microbiome and contribute to antibiotic resistance [171,293]. Researchers are investigating strategies to selectively target pathogens while preserving the diversity and functionality of the microbiome. This includes developing antibiotics that specifically target pathogenic bacteria or using adjuvants, such as probiotics or prebiotics, alongside antibiotics to mitigate their negative effects on the microbiome.

Additionally, researchers are exploring the potential of using CRISPR-Cas systems to selectively eliminate or modify harmful bacteria within the microbiome [294]. CRISPR-Cas is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows precise modifications of genetic material [295,296]. By utilizing CRISPR-Cas systems, we can design specific guide RNAs to target and destroy pathogenic bacteria or disrupt their virulence factors. This approach holds promise for developing highly targeted and customizable treatments for infectious diseases.

One promising area of research is the development of microbiome-targeted nanoparticles for drug delivery [297,298]. These nanoparticles can be engineered to specifically target and penetrate the microbial communities within the body. By encapsulating antimicrobial agents or other therapeutic compounds, these nanoparticles can deliver the treatment directly to the site of infection, increasing its effectiveness and reducing systemic side effects [298,299,300,301,302,303]. Additionally, the nanoparticles can be designed to release the therapeutic agents in response to specific cues or conditions within the microbiome, further enhancing their targeted action.

Another emerging approach involves utilizing gene therapy techniques to modulate the microbiome and combat infectious diseases. By introducing specific genes into the microbiome, researchers aim to enhance the production of antimicrobial compounds, boost immune responses, or restore microbial balance. This approach holds potential for developing targeted and long-lasting interventions that can help prevent or treat infectious diseases.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential of microbial-derived products as therapeutic agents. These products include metabolites, enzymes, and proteins produced by the microbiome that have antimicrobial or immunomodulatory properties [304,305,306,307,308]. Researchers are exploring ways to harness these natural products for therapeutic purposes. For example, certain microbial metabolites have shown antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant pathogens, making them attractive candidates for developing new treatments. Furthermore, enzymes produced by the microbiome can be used to degrade biofilms formed by pathogenic bacteria, enhancing the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies.

Additionally, researchers are investigating the potential of bioengineered microbiomes as a treatment strategy. By engineering synthetic microbial communities with specific functional characteristics, scientists aim to create microbiomes that can outcompete and eliminate pathogenic bacteria [309,310]. These bioengineered microbiomes can be designed to produce antimicrobial substances, enhance immune responses, or restore microbial diversity and stability. This approach offers a unique opportunity to tailor the microbiome to combat specific infectious diseases.

One emerging area of research is the use of bacteriocins as therapeutic agents. Bacteriocins are AMPs produced by bacteria that can selectively target and kill other bacteria, including pathogenic strains [311,312]. The potential of harnessing these naturally occurring antimicrobial compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases is being explored. Bacteriocins can be engineered or modified to enhance their stability, potency, and specificity against target pathogens [313,314]. By leveraging bacteriocins, we aim to develop targeted antimicrobial therapies that minimize harm to the beneficial microbes within the microbiome.

Another approach involves the use of microbiome transplantation from healthy animal models to treat infectious diseases. Animal models with a naturally resistant or tolerant microbiome can serve as sources for microbiome transplantation to infected or susceptible individuals [315]. By transferring the microbiota from these resistant animals, we aim to enhance the microbial diversity and functionality of the recipient’s microbiome, providing a more robust defense against pathogens. This approach holds promise for developing novel treatments, particularly for infections that are difficult to treat with conventional therapies.

Furthermore, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of host-directed therapies that modulate the host immune response to combat infectious diseases. The microbiome has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating immune function, and dysbiosis can contribute to immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections [90,316]. Exploring interventions such as immune-modulating drugs, dietary interventions, or fecal transplantation to restore a healthy balance in the microbiome and enhance host immunity against pathogens is very crucial.

Additionally, researchers are investigating the potential of using synthetic biology approaches to engineer microbiomes for targeted disease treatment [317,318]. By designing and introducing synthetic genetic circuits into specific microbial populations within the microbiome, we aim to enhance their ability to produce antimicrobial compounds, compete with pathogenic strains, or modulate immune responses. This field of research offers exciting possibilities for developing tailored therapies that can precisely target and manipulate the microbiome to combat infectious diseases.

Personalized medicine is an innovative approach that customizes medical treatments based on individual characteristics, including genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Its primary goal is to enhance effectiveness by offering accurate diagnoses, predicting disease risks, and selecting tailored therapies. By optimizing healthcare outcomes and improving patient well-being, personalized medicine strives to revolutionize the field of healthcare. Personalized medicine has the potential to revolutionize the approach to infectious diseases by analyzing an individual’s microbiome profile [319]. The microbiome refers to the vast community of microorganisms that reside within and on our bodies, playing a crucial role in maintaining our health. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have made it possible to characterize the microbiome in unprecedented detail, providing valuable insights into infectious diseases [320]. The composition of an individual’s microbiome has been linked to various infectious diseases, including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, and STIs [17,24,80]. By studying the microbial communities associated with these diseases, we can identify potential pathogens and their interactions with the host immune system. This knowledge can guide the development of targeted therapies that specifically address the underlying microbial imbalances associated with the disease.

Furthermore, the microbiome has been shown to influence the efficacy and toxicity of antimicrobial agents. Different microorganisms within the microbiome possess varying degrees of resistance or susceptibility to specific drugs. By analyzing an individual’s microbiome profile, healthcare professionals can predict drug responses and select appropriate antibiotics or antivirals that are more likely to be effective against the specific pathogens present [321,322]. This personalized approach can minimize the risk of treatment failure or adverse drug reactions, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes.

In addition to guiding treatment decisions, understanding an individual’s microbiome can also inform preventive strategies for infectious diseases. By identifying individuals who are more susceptible to certain infections based on their microbiome composition, targeted interventions such as probiotic supplementation or prebiotic dietary modifications can be implemented to restore microbial balance and reduce the risk of infection.

Moreover, the microbiome plays a critical role in modulating the immune system, which is essential for fighting off infections. By understanding an individual’s microbiome profile, healthcare professionals can gain insights into the functioning of the immune system and its dysregulation in infectious diseases [323,324,325]. This knowledge can guide the development of immunomodulatory therapies that target specific pathways or immune cell populations, ultimately enhancing the body’s ability to combat infections.

Personalized medicine based on the microbiome also holds promise in the field of diagnostics. By analyzing an individual’s microbiome, it becomes possible to identify patterns or signatures associated with different infections [326,327]. These microbial biomarkers can serve as diagnostic tools for the early detection and monitoring of infectious diseases [328,329]. Researchers are investigating gut microbiota signatures, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), as potential biomarkers for infectious diseases [328]. Furthermore, associations between microbial diversity, gene expression patterns in the gut microbiota, and susceptibility to infectious diseases have also been observed [330]. Investigating microbiota signatures associated with invasive Candida infections offers insights into diagnostic and therapeutic targets [331]. Furthermore, the use of microbiome-based diagnostics can facilitate rapid and accurate identification of drug-resistant pathogens, enabling targeted antimicrobial therapy and preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance.

In the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), personalized medicine approaches based on the microbiome can help identify patients who are at a higher risk of developing these infections. This knowledge can be used to implement targeted interventions, such as probiotic therapy or the use of prebiotics, to promote a healthy microbiome and reduce the risk of HAIs. Personalized medicine approaches that focus on the microbiome have the potential to greatly improve infection control practices in healthcare settings and enhance patient safety.

By understanding an individual’s microbiome composition, healthcare professionals can identify specific microbial species or functional pathways that may enhance or hinder treatment responses [317,332,333]. This knowledge can guide the development of strategies to modulate the microbiome, such as targeted probiotics or FMT, with the aim of improving therapeutic outcomes.

In terms of vaccine development, analyzing an individual’s microbiome can provide insights into the interactions between the immune system and resident microbial communities. This knowledge can guide the development of novel vaccines that harness the immune-modulating properties of the microbiome to enhance vaccine efficacy and duration of protection [106,108,334,335]. Microbiome-based vaccines have the potential to offer a more personalized and effective approach to preventing infectious diseases.

Furthermore, personalized medicine approaches based on an individual’s microbiome profile can contribute to precision antimicrobial therapy. By analyzing an individual’s microbiome profile, healthcare providers can identify the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and predict their potential impact on treatment outcomes. This information can guide the selection of appropriate antibiotics or alternative antimicrobial strategies that are more likely to be effective against specific pathogens present, while minimizing the risk of promoting further antibiotic resistance.

The integration of big data technologies in personalized medicine offers exciting prospects for infectious diseases [335,336]. By combining vast amounts of microbiome data with clinical information and outcomes, researchers can identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent through traditional methods [337,338,339]. AI algorithms can analyze these complex datasets and generate predictive models to guide personalized medicine interventions. This data-driven approach has the potential to revolutionize infectious disease management by providing clinicians with actionable insights for diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring of therapeutic responses.

Personalized medicine based on an individual’s microbiome profile also offers the opportunity to uncover new therapeutic targets for infectious diseases. The microbiome is a rich source of bioactive molecules and metabolites that can have diverse effects on human health and disease [323,324,340]. By studying the microbial communities within the microbiome, researchers can identify specific molecules or pathways that contribute to disease progression or protection against infections. This knowledge can guide the development of novel therapies that target these specific microbial components, potentially leading to more effective and tailored treatments for infectious diseases.

Moreover, personalized medicine in infectious diseases can extend beyond individual treatment to population-level interventions. By analyzing large-scale microbiome data from different populations, researchers can identify patterns and trends that may influence disease prevalence, transmission, and response to interventions. This information can guide public health strategies, such as vaccination campaigns or targeted antimicrobial stewardship programs, to address specific infectious diseases in different populations. Personalized medicine approaches that consider the microbiome have the potential to inform proactive measures for disease prevention and improve population-level health outcomes.

One emerging area of personalized medicine in infectious diseases is the role of the microbiome in predicting disease outcomes and complications [341]. By analyzing an individual’s microbiome profile, healthcare professionals can identify microbial signatures or biomarkers that are indicative of disease progression or the likelihood of developing complications, helping guide treatment decisions, facilitate early intervention, and improve patient management strategies.

Furthermore, personalized medicine based on an individual’s microbiome profile holds great potential for the development of novel therapeutics, such as microbiome-based interventions. By analyzing an individual’s microbiome profile, healthcare providers can identify specific microbial imbalances and design tailored interventions to restore a healthy microbiome and improve outcomes in infectious diseases. This can be achieved through targeted probiotic therapy, prebiotic supplementation, or even the development of microbial-based therapeutics. Personalized medicine based on an individual’s microbiome profile shows promise in identifying novel therapeutic targets for infectious diseases. By studying an individual’s microbiome profile, we can identify unique microbial species or functional pathways associated with specific infectious diseases, opening up new avenues for targeted therapies. Additionally, personalized medicine based on an individual’s microbiome profile can contribute to strategies for disease prevention and public health interventions by analyzing large-scale microbiome data from different populations to identify patterns and trends associated with disease susceptibility or transmission. This information can inform public health initiatives, such as vaccination campaigns or targeted antimicrobial stewardship programs.

The study of the microbiome in the context of infectious diseases presents several challenges that we must overcome (Table 2). First, the microbiome itself is incredibly complex, consisting of a vast community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms [342]. Understanding the interactions between these microorganisms and their host in the context of infectious diseases is difficult due to this complexity. Second, the dynamic nature of the microbiome adds another layer of challenge, as its composition and diversity can vary significantly between individuals and over time [343]. This variability makes it challenging to establish consistent associations between specific microbial communities and infectious diseases. Third, studying the microbiome in infectious diseases requires advanced analytical tools and techniques [344,345,346]. Traditional culture-based methods are limited in their ability to identify and characterize the majority of microorganisms present in the microbiome. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as metagenomic sequencing, are used to analyze microbial DNA but generate large amounts of data that require sophisticated bioinformatics analyses [347]. Fourth, ethical considerations play a crucial role in studying the microbiome. Accessing and analyzing samples raises privacy concerns, requiring researchers to navigate complex ethical frameworks to ensure informed consent, privacy protection, and proper communication of research findings. Lastly, the presence of unculturable or difficult-to-study microorganisms in the microbiome restricts our ability to fully characterize and understand their functional roles in infectious diseases [348].

The microbiome, which extends beyond the human body to include the environment, plays a role in the spread and transmission of infectious diseases. However, studying the microbiome within a broader ecological context adds complexity and requires interdisciplinary collaborations and data integration. Understanding the microbiome’s association with infectious diseases is further complicated by confounding factors such as host genetics, immune status, and underlying health conditions [24,349]. These factors must be carefully addressed through experimental design and statistical analysis to accurately identify microbial signatures and develop targeted interventions.

Translating microbiome research into clinical applications is challenging due to individual variations in the microbiome and evolving regulatory frameworks [350]. Establishing causality and developing effective interventions remain complex tasks, requiring further research, clinical trials, and collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies. Standardization of methodologies and protocols is another challenge in microbiome research, hindering comparability and reproducibility. Efforts are being made to establish standardized protocols and reference datasets to overcome this obstacle [351,352,353].

While bacterial communities have received significant attention, the role of viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms in the microbiome remains less understood [354]. Investigating these components presents challenges such as limited knowledge of their interactions with the host immune system and difficulties in distinguishing between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms. Longitudinal studies tracking changes in the microbiome over time are necessary to understand temporal dynamics and causal relationships with infectious diseases [324,355]. However, conducting such studies poses logistical challenges related to follow-up, sample collection, data analysis, participant retention, compliance, and the potential impacts of interventions.

The translation of microbiome research into clinical practice faces hurdles, including regulatory barriers, and the need for robust clinical validation. Integration of microbiome-based approaches into healthcare systems requires collaborations between researchers, clinicians, industry partners, and regulatory agencies to establish evidence-based guidelines and ensure clinical utility and safety.

Careful consideration of factors like age, sex, geographical location, diet, medications, and underlying health conditions during study design and statistical analysis is essential for accurate findings [356,357,358,359,360]. Additionally, the vast amount of data generated from microbiome studies poses challenges in terms of storage, management, and analysis. Robust computational infrastructure and bioinformatics expertise are required to process and integrate such data effectively. The availability of computational resources can be a challenge for many research groups.

There is a need for deeper comprehension of the biological activities and interactions within the microbiome, which requires specialized techniques like metatranscriptomics and metabolomics [361]. Incorporating these techniques into routine microbiome research is challenging due to the need for expertise and resources. Interdisciplinary collaborations are necessary to study the microbiome in the context of infectious diseases effectively. Researchers from various fields, including microbiology, immunology, genetics, bioinformatics, and clinical medicine, need to work together to tackle the complexity of the microbiome [362]. However, building effective collaborations and fostering communication across disciplines can be challenging due to differences in terminology, methodologies, and research cultures. The heterogeneity within infectious diseases themselves poses a significant challenge. Different diseases have distinct etiologies, pathogenic mechanisms, and host responses, leading to variations in microbial factors contributing to each disease. Additionally, studying the microbiome across different stages of infection and disease progression adds another layer of complexity as the microbial communities may change dynamically over time [363]. Establishing causality between the microbiome and infectious diseases is another challenge. While associations between specific microbial communities and disease states have been identified, determining cause-and-effect relationships is challenging [364]. Experimental models can provide insights into the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences infectious diseases, but validating these findings in human populations requires careful integration of multiple lines of evidence. Standardization of sample collection and processing methods is crucial for cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses [365]. Variability in these protocols can introduce biases and hinder the reproducibility of the results. Efforts are being made to establish guidelines and best practices for sample collection and processing to ensure consistency and comparability across studies. Understanding the ecological dynamics within the microbiome and how perturbations impact its stability and function is essential. Factors like antibiotic usage, infection treatments, or changes in environmental conditions can disrupt the balance of the microbiome, leading to dysbiosis [366,367,368]. Determining the resilience of the microbiome and its capacity to recover from perturbations is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Data integration and interpretation pose challenges due to variations in study design, sampling protocols, sequencing platforms, and bioinformatics pipelines. Standardized data repositories and analytical frameworks are being developed to facilitate data sharing and integration. Microbial interdependencies and interactions within the microbiome add complexity. Understanding these intricate microbial networks and their dynamics is crucial for comprehending the overall functioning of the microbiome in infectious diseases [369,370]. Conducting large-scale, multicenter studies poses logistical and coordination challenges. Collaborative efforts are necessary to collect diverse samples from different populations, locations, and disease contexts [371]. Implementing standardized protocols, quality control measures, and coordinating data management require effective communication, resources, and infrastructure. Translating microbiome research into clinical practice and public health interventions requires rigorous validation, regulatory approvals, and evidence-based guidelines [372]. Overcoming barriers related to cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and feasibility is essential. Longitudinal studies with well-defined cohorts are needed to understand the temporal dynamics of the microbiome in infectious diseases. Long-term commitment, extensive follow-up, and careful coordination are required for sample collection at specific time points [373]. Standardized metadata collection and reporting are necessary to integrate and compare data across studies. Establishing standardized metadata standards and guidelines would facilitate data harmonization, improve reproducibility, and enable meta-analyses [373]. Identifying causal mechanisms between specific microbes or microbial functions and infectious diseases remains complex. Experimental validation and functional studies are required to establish causality. Exploring the “microbial dark matter” within the microbiome presents technological and conceptual challenges [374]. Innovative techniques can help shed light on uncultured microorganisms’ functions and interactions with the host [375,376]. Host genetics can shape the microbiome and impact susceptibility to infectious diseases. Comprehensive genetic studies and integrative analyses are essential for understanding the interplay between host genetics, the microbiome, and infectious diseases [377]. Early-life exposures can have long-term implications for the development of the microbiome and infectious disease susceptibility [378,379]. Longitudinal cohort studies are needed to study these effects into adulthood. The role of the microbiome in modulating immune responses during infectious diseases is an active area of investigation. Understanding this complex crosstalk requires comprehensive knowledge of immunology, microbiology, and host–microbe interactions.
