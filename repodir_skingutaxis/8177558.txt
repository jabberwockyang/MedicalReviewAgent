Immunoglobulins (Igs) are complex glycoproteins that play critical functions in innate and adaptive immunity of all jawed vertebrates. Given the unique characteristics of mucosal barriers, secretory Igs (sIgs) have specialized to maintain homeostasis and keep pathogens at bay at mucosal tissues from fish to mammals. In teleost fish, the three main IgH isotypes, IgM, IgD and IgT/Z can be found in different proportions at the mucosal secretions of the skin, gills, gut, nasal, buccal, and pharyngeal mucosae. Similar to the role of mammalian IgA, IgT plays a predominant role in fish mucosal immunity. Recent studies in IgT have illuminated the primordial role of sIgs in both microbiota homeostasis and pathogen control at mucosal sites. Ten years ago, IgT was discovered to be an immunoglobulin class specialized in mucosal immunity. Aiming at this 10-year anniversary, the goal of this review is to summarize the current status of the field of fish Igs since that discovery, while identifying knowledge gaps and future avenues that will move the field forward in both basic and applied science areas.
