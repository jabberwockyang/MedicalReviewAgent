Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as an expanding family of effector cells particularly enriched in the mucosal barriers. ILCs are promptly activated by stress signals and multiple epithelial- and myeloid-cell-derived cytokines. In response, ILCs rapidly secrete effector cytokines, which allow them to survey and maintain the mucosal integrity. Uncontrolled action of ILCs might contribute to tissue damage, chronic inflammation, metabolic diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the cytokine network that modulate ILC immune responses: stimulating cytokines, signature cytokines secreted by ILC subsets, autocrine cytokines, and cytokines that induce cell plasticity.
