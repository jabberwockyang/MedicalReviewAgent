Previous work from the HLA-B27 transgenic rat model of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) suggests that macrophages develop an intracellular stress response called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and as a result secrete increased cytokines in response to Toll like receptor agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our objective was to determine if macrophages from AS patients also undergo an UPR and secrete increased cytokines/chemokines in response to LPS.

Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from 10 AS patients and healthy controls were differentiated in vitro with M-CSF. Select samples were treated with IFN-γ to up-regulate MHC class I (HLA-B) expression prior to stimulation with LPS for 3h (for RNA collection), or 8–24h (for supernatant collection). UPR induction was assessed by expression of ERdj4, BiP and CHOP mRNA.

Although IFN-γ treatment up-regulated HLA-B expression 2-fold(p=0.0094), neither IFN-γ nor LPS enhanced BiP or CHOP expression substantially (<1.3 fold). ERdj4 expression increased weakly but insignificantly in IFN-γ+LPS AS samples (2.2 fold, p=0.31). In response to LPS, AS macrophages secreted more CXCL9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-23, and TNF-α than controls(p ≤ 0.025)The most striking difference was observed for IL-23 (median AS patient 265 pg/mL vs. control 9 pg/mL, p=0.0007). We did not detect significant differences in IL-6, IL-8, or IFN-β production.

Greater IL-23 production by AS patient macrophages in response to LPS provides further support for the development of Th17/IL23-directed therapy. Since significant UPR induction was not detected in AS patient macrophages, the relationship between UPR and inflammatory cytokine production remains unclear.
