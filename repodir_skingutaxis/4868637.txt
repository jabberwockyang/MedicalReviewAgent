Chorioamnionitis is associated with preterm labor and fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS), causing fetal organ injury and morbidity particularly in extremely premature infants. However, the effects of inflammation on the fetal immune system remain poorly understood, due to the difficulty of studying immune development in infants. Therefore, we used the model of intra-amniotic (IA) LPS administered at ~80% gestation in rhesus monkeys to cause chorioamnionitis and FIRS that is similar in human pathology. Importantly, the frequency of IL-17+ and IL-22+ CD4+ T-cells increased in the spleen of LPS-exposed fetuses, while Treg frequency decreased. These changes persisted for at least 48h. Notably, Th17 cytokines were predominantly expressed by FoxP3+CD4+ T-cells and not by their FoxP3− counterparts. Bi-functional IL17+FoxP3+ exhibited a phenotype of inflammatory Treg (RORcHigh/+, HeliosLow/−, IL-2+, IFNγ+ and IL-8+) compared to typical FoxP3+ cells. Diminished splenic Treg frequency in LPS-exposed fetuses was associated with inadequate Treg generation in the thymus. Mechanistically, the emergence of inflammatory Treg was largely dependent on IL-1 signaling. However, blockage of IL-1R signaling did not abolish the deleterious effects of LPS on Treg frequency in the thymus or spleen. Collectively, we demonstrate that a prenatal inflammatory environment leads to inadequate Treg generation in the thymus with a switch of splenic Treg towards an inflammatory phenotype. Both processes likely contribute to the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis. Approaches to manipulate Treg numbers and function could thus be useful therapeutically to alleviate FIRS in preterm infants.
