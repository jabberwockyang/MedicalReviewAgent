There has been increasing interest in understanding the role of the human microbiome in skin diseases. Microbiome studies are being utilized in skin cancer research in numerous ways. Commensal bacteria are being studied as a potential tool to judge the biggest environmental risk of skin cancer, ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Owing to the recognized link of skin microbes in the process of inflammation, there have been theories linking commensal bacteria to skin cancer. Viral metagenomics has also provided insight into virus linked forms of skin cancers. Speculations can be drawn for skin microbiome that in a manner similar to gut microbiome, they can be involved in chemoprevention of skin cancer. Nonetheless, there are definitely huge gaps in our knowledge of the relationship of microbiome and skin cancers, especially in relation to chemoprevention. The utilization of microbiome in skin cancer research seems to be a promising field and may help yield novel skin cancer prevention and treatment options. This review focuses on recent utilization of the microbiome in skin cancer research, and it explores the potential of utilizing the microbiome in prevention, earlier diagnosis, and treatment of skin cancers.
