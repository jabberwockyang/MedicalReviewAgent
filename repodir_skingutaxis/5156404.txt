Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a family of innate immune cells that have diverse functions during homeostasis and disease. Subsets of ILCs have phenotypes that mirror polarized T helper subsets in their expression of core transcription factors and effector cytokines. Given the similarities between these two classes of lymphocytes, it is important to understand which functions of ILCs are specialized and which are redundant in comparison to T cells. Here, we discuss genetic mouse models that have been used to dissect the contributions of ILCs versus T cells, and review our current understanding of the specialized in vivo functions of ILCs.
