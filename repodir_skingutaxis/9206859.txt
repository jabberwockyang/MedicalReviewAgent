Early life is a dynamic period for skin microbial colonization and immune development. We postulate that microbial exposures in this period durably alter the skin immune trajectory and later disease susceptibility. Bacteria contribute to infant skin immune imprinting via interactions with microbes as well as with cutaneous epithelial and immune cells. Excellent research is underway at the skin microbiome–immune interface, both in deciphering basic mechanisms and implementing their therapeutic applications. As emphasized herein, focusing on the unique opportunities and challenges presented by microbial immune modulation in early life will be important. In our view, only through dedicated study of skin–microbe crosstalk in this developmental window can we elucidate the molecular underpinnings of pivotal events that contribute to sustained host–microbe symbiosis.
