Signaling through the interleukin (IL)-22 cytokine axis provides essential immune protection in the setting of extracellular infection as part of type 17 immunity. Molecular regulation of IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) protein levels is unknown. In murine lung epithelia, IL-22R is a relatively short-lived protein (t½ ∼1.5 h) degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome under normal unstimulated conditions, but its degradation is accelerated by IL-22 treatment. Lys449 within the intracellular C-terminal domain of the IL-22R serves as a ubiquitin acceptor site as disruption of this site by deletion or site-directed mutagenesis creates an IL-22R variant that, when expressed in cells, is degradation-resistant and not ubiquitinated. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β phosphorylates the IL-22R within a consensus phosphorylation signature at Ser410 and Ser414, and IL-22 treatment of cells triggers GSK-3β inactivation. GSK-3β overexpression results in accumulation of IL-22R protein, whereas GSK-3β depletion in cells reduces levels of the receptor. Mutagenesis of IL-22R at Ser410 and Ser414 results in receptor variants that display reduced phosphorylation levels and are more labile as compared with wild-type IL-22R when expressed in cells. Further, the cytoskeletal protein cortactin, which is important for epithelial spreading and barrier formation, is phosphorylated and activated at the epithelial cell leading edge after treatment with IL-22, but this effect is reduced after GSK-3β knockdown. These findings reveal the ability of GSK-3β to modulate IL-22R protein stability that might have significant implications for cytoprotective functions and therapeutic targeting of the IL-22 signaling axis.
