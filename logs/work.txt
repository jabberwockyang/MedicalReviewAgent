Both organs have a rich network of immune cells, including T-regs, which play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. Dysregulation of these cells, as seen in immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1, can lead to the development of irritable bowel disease (IBD) and skin reactions, or conversely, skin conditions like irritable cutaneous adverse events (ircAEs).\n\nThe skin-gut axis is supported by the observation that some dermatologic conditions can have gastrointestinal manifestations, and gastrointestinal disorders can also affect the skin.
