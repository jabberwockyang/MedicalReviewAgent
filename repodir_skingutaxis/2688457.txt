Burn injury induces an immunopathological response that can contribute to the development of a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) and subsequent multiple organ failure. While, multiple immune cells type (T-cells, macrophages, neutrophils) are involved in this response, recent evidence suggests that a unique T-cell subset, γδ T-cells are central in the response to injury. While γδ T-cells represent only a small percentage of the total T-cell population, they display specific functional characteristics that uniquely position them in the immune/inflammatory axis to influence a number of important aspects of the body’s response to burn injury. This review will focus on the potential regulator role of γδ T-cells in immunopathological response following burn injury and thereby their potential as therapeutic targets for modulation of post-burn inflammation and healing.
