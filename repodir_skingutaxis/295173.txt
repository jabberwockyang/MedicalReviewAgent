We report the immunological characteristics of five patients with Omenn's syndrome, a rare inherited immunodeficiency also known as combined immunodeficiency with hypereosinophilia. The syndrome is characterized by T cell infiltration of skin, gut, liver, and spleen leading to diffuse erythroderma, protracted diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly. Blood T cells as well as those infiltrating the skin and gut were found to express activation markers and were partially activated by mitogens but not by antigens. Although the lesions resembled those in graft-versus-host disease, the blood T cells were shown by DNA haplotype analysis using probes revealing variable number of tandem repeats to belong to the patients as well as the T cells infiltrating the gut and skin in one patient. A given T cell subset (TCR alpha beta+, CD4+/CD8+, or TCR gamma delta+) was predominant in each patient, with a specific distribution in the skin lesions. Moreover, the study of T cell receptor beta, gamma, and delta gene rearrangements in four patients revealed oligoclonality involving C beta 1, C beta 2, or different V gamma J gamma or V delta J delta genes. This indicates that restricted heterogeneity of the T cell repertoire, previously reported in one case, is a major feature of this syndrome. The occurrence of alymphocytosis-type severe combined immunodeficiency in the brother of one of the patients suggests that the restricted heterogeneity of T cell receptor gene usage in Omenn's syndrome may arise from leakiness, within the context of a genetically determined faulty T cell differentiation.
