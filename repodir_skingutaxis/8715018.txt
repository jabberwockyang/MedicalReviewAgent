Human organ-on-a-chip models are powerful tools for preclinical research that can be used to study the mechanisms of disease and evaluate new targets for therapeutic intervention. Lung-on-a-chip models have been one of the most well-characterized designs in this field and can be altered to evaluate various types of respiratory disease and to assess treatment candidates prior to clinical testing. These systems are capable of overcoming the flaws of conventional two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture and in vivo animal testing due to their ability to accurately recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment of human tissue with tunable material properties, microfluidic integration, delivery of precise mechanical and biochemical cues, and designs with organ-specific architecture. In this review, we first describe an overview of currently available lung-on-a-chip designs. We then present how recent innovations in human stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication can be used to create more predictive human lung-on-a-chip models for studying respiratory disease. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future directions of lung-on-a-chip designs for in vitro disease modeling with a particular focus on immune and multiorgan interactions.
