Despite an ever-increasing appreciation for how protein-coding genes shape immune responses, the molecular underpinnings of immune regulation remain incompletely understood. This incomplete picture impedes the development of more precise therapeutics and diagnostics for immune-mediated diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are versatile cell- and context-specific regulators of gene expression and cellular function. The number of lncRNA genes rivals that of protein-coding genes; however, comparatively little is known about their function. Even though the functions of most lncRNA genes are unknown, multiple lncRNAs have recently emerged as important immune regulators. Therefore, further unlocking the role of lncRNAs in the immune system coupled with their tissue-specific expression might lead to more precise therapeutics and diagnostics for immune disorders in general.
