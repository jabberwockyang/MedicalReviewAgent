The human brain is populated by perivascular T cells with a tissue-resident memory T (TRM)-cell phenotype, which in multiple sclerosis (MS) associate with lesions. We investigated the transcriptional and functional profile of freshly isolated T cells from white and gray matter. RNA sequencing of CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells revealed TRM-cell signatures. Notably, gene expression hardly differed between lesional and normal-appearing white matter T cells in MS brains. Genes up-regulated in brain TRM cells were MS4A1 (CD20) and SPP1 (osteopontin, OPN). OPN is also abundantly expressed by microglia and has been shown to inhibit T cell activity. In line with their parenchymal localization and the increased presence of OPN in active MS lesions, we noticed a reduced production of inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF, and IFNγ by lesion-derived CD8+ and CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Our study reports traits of brain TRM cells and reveals their tight control in MS lesions.

The human central nervous system (CNS) is an immune-privileged site with a tight control of inflammatory responses.1,2 This status has been attributed to a combination of strictly compartmentalized organization, regulated transportation of molecules over the blood–brain barrier, parenchymal expression of immune-regulatory molecules, and controlled trafficking of surveilling immune cells. The CNS is surrounded by meninges containing the subarachnoid space, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates. In individuals without brain diseases, this compartment is patrolled by more CD4+ than CD8+ T cells with a most dominant CCR7+ central memory T cell (TCM) phenotype.3,4 Choroid plexus and meningeal vasculature have been identified as main ports of entry for T cells in the subarachnoid space,4,5 with specialized meningeal lymphoid vessels mediating return toward secondary lymphoid organs.6

In predominantly postmortem studies, the white matter (WM) areas of the brain have been shown to contain low numbers of T cells.7 These cells are primarily located in the perivascular space (PVS) surrounding the infiltrating and draining vessels of WM.8 Although this compartment is a continuum of the subarachnoid space, phenotypically different T cells have been noted. The PVS contains more CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cells, which are characterized by a dominant CCR7− CD69+CD103+/− tissue-resident memory T (TRM)-cell phenotype.2,8,9 Persisting in various human tissues,10 TRM cells are believed to be remnants of a prior primary antigen encounter facilitating a rapid local recall response after re-challenge with their antigen. Accordingly, in animal studies, infections with neurotropic viruses drive development of TRM-cell pools in the brain.11,12 Lack of re-circulation molecules on TRM cells causes their permanent retention to specific tissue compartments.13 However, the strict localization of brain TRM cells in the PVS contrasts to the more scattered distribution found in other tissues.14 In addition, we observed low expression of CD20 to mark subsets of human brain TRM cells,15 which has not been reported as a prominent feature in other tissues. These observations suggest the presence of unique features of brain TRM cells adapting to residence within the unique CNS environment.

Brain TRM cells may not only be innocent sentinels but also contribute detrimentally to neuroinflammatory diseases. In late-stage multiple sclerosis (MS) autopsies, we and others showed that brain T cells expand and localize in the brain parenchyma in association with active MS lesions.16,17 MS lesional T cells showed expression of core TRM-cell markers (CD69, CD103, CD49a, PD-1, and CD20), although differential expression of some markers suggested a higher migratory potential (CXCR6), a higher activation state (Ki-67), and a higher cytotoxic potential (GPR56).15,17 Intriguingly, a clonal expansion of CSF CD8+ T cells displaying TRM-cell like characteristics has been noted in MS-discordant twins and has been argued to be one of the earliest events in the onset of MS.18 How brain TRM cells are recruited and if and how these cells contribute to ongoing disease activity in advanced MS remains to be investigated.

The aim of our current study was to further consolidate the phenotype of human brain TRM cells and to identify dominant or unique features relevant for their local compartmentalization and control. Furthermore, we explored the versatility of this profile in association with lesion formation in MS.

CD8+ and CD4+ T cells of corpus callosum WM, cortical gray matter (GM), and paired peripheral blood were isolated from n = 11 deceased human brain donors that subsequently came to obduction at the Netherlands Brain Bank (Figure S1). Blood cells were sorted into effector memory T cells (TEM) and effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) based on co-expression of CCR7 and CD45RA (Figure 1A). Brain cells were sorted for presence of the TRM-cell marker CD69, found on 96.9 ± 1.4% of WM CD8+ T cells, 89.9 ± 9.2% of GM CD8+ T cells, 89.1 ± 7.2% of WM CD4+ T cells, and 70.4 ± 22.9% of GM CD4+ T cells. As expected, 43.9 ± 22.2% of WM CD8+ T cells and 28.6 ± 20.3% of GM CD8+ T cells, but almost no WM or GM CD4+ T cells expressed CD103 (Figure 1B). Brain CD8+ T cells showed a strong correlation of CD69+CD103- and CD69+CD103+ proportions between WM and GM (Figure S2). The obtained cell numbers enabled bulk RNA sequencing of all individual blood and brain WM samples, whereas n = 5 CD8+ and all CD4+ GM samples with cell numbers <2,000 had to be pooled for sufficient input. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation of CD8+ and CD4+ as well as of blood and brain T cell samples, respectively (Figure 1C). Robust presence of T cell-specific transcripts (CD3D, CD4, CD8A) and low detection of transcripts associated with B cells (CD19), microglia (P2RY12), astrocytes (AQP4), oligodendrocytes (MAG), and neurons (MAP2) confirmed the purity of the obtained T cell transcriptomes (Figure 1D).Figure 1Whole-transcriptome profiling of brain CD8+and CD4+ CD69+ T cellsBulk RNA sequencing was performed of corresponding CD8+ and CD4+ blood TEM and TEMRA cells and brain WM and GM CD69+ T cells from n = 11 brain donors (first dataset).(A) Representative plots showing the flow cytometry gating strategy used for obtaining the samples for RNA sequencing.(B) Percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets in the blood and brain samples processed for RNA sequencing, determined by flow cytometry.(C) Expression of genes associated with T cells (CD3D, CD4, CD8A), B cells (CD19), microglia (P2RY12), astrocytes (AQP4), oligodendrocytes (MAG), and neurons (MAP2) in the sequenced samples, obtained by RNA sequencing.

We next compared the obtained transcriptomes with the core gene signature of human CD69+ TRM cells reported by Kumar et al., comprising 13 upregulated and 18 downregulated genes.13 Brain CD69+ T cells matched this signature, indicated by high gene expression of the adhesion molecules ITGA1 (CD49a) and ITGAE (CD103), the interleukins IL2 and IL10, the chemokine receptor CXCR6, the dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6, and the T cell-inhibitory receptor PDCD1 (PD-1) as well as by low gene expression of the lymph node-homing factor SELL (CD62L), the Krüppel-like transcription factors KLF2 and KLF3, the sphingosine receptor and immune modulator S1PR1, and the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, in comparison to blood TEM(RA) cells (Figure 1E). This was further confirmed in a competitive gene set enrichment analysis (Figure S3). Despite the variable background of the brain donors, consisting of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, depression, and MS, as well as controls with no known neurological disorders, brain CD69+ memory T cells displayed a consistent transcriptional profile that clearly differed from circulating TEM(RA) cells.

Comparison of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from WM, GM, and blood disclosed genes expressed at lower or higher levels in brain CD69+ T cells (Figure 2A). These differentially expressed (DE) genes comprised generic core signature genes of human TRM cells (see above) as well as genes specifically regulated in brain-resident T cells. Several of these genes were robustly regulated across brain CD69+ T cells (Figure 2B and Data S1). Genes consistently underexpressed were S1PR1, S1PR5, and KLRG1 (Figure 2C). Overexpressed genes, confirmed at protein level by flow cytometry, were SPP1, IL2, IL2RA, MS4A1, CCR2, and CCR5 (Figures 2D and S4). Two genes aroused particular interest. SPP1 (osteopontin, OPN) was the most upregulated gene in WM and GM CD8+ T cells as well as WM CD4+ T cells. MS4A1 (CD20) was upregulated in CD8+ WM, CD8+ GM, and CD4+ WM versus circulating TEMRA cells, upregulated in CD8+ GM and CD4+ WM and approached significance in CD8+ WM T cells versus circulating TEM cells (adjusted p = 0.07), with substantial expression levels (44th percentile of whole transcriptome) (Figure S5). This is in line with the intermediate expression of CD20 by a higher proportion of brain CD8+ CD69+ T cells compared to circulating CD8+ T cells reported recently by us.15Figure 2Brain-specific characteristics of CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells(A) Volcano plots displaying differential gene expression between CD8+ and CD4+ blood TEM and TEMRA cells and brain WM and GM CD69+ T cells.

Given the particularly high gene activity of SPP1, we further explored OPN protein expression by brain T cells using immunofluorescence staining. T cells are known to actively secrete OPN.19 Accordingly, OPN was observed in extracellular deposits near perivascular but also near the incidental parenchymal T cells (Figure 3A). Frequently, T cells were found in the vicinity of larger aggregates of OPN (Figure 3B). In line with the flow-cytometric analyses, OPN was also detected inside cells, and we therefore quantified extra- and intracellular expression. We noticed that OPN was present in a mean of 75 ± 23% of all T cells (Figure S6). In summary, expression of OPN, together with intermediate presence of CD20, is a hallmark of brain-resident CD69+ T cells.Figure 3OPN is a spatial hallmark in proximity of brain TRM cells(A) OPN expressed in smaller extracellular deposits in the proximity of T cells (arrowhead) as well as within a T cell (asterisk).(B) T cell aggregation in vicinity of a large extracellular OPN deposition in a non-demented control donor. Shown are immunofluorescence stainings at 63× magnification; scale bar = 20 μm or 5 μm (magnifications).

Previous studies of brain T cells analyzed cells from different WM regions.8,9 To explore regional differences, we isolated CD8+ T cells from subcortical WM, corpus callosum WM, and medulla WM/GM of n = 3–5 deceased human brain donors and processed sorted CD69+ CD8+ T cells for bulk RNA sequencing (Figure 4A). The percentage of all CD8+ T cells co-expressing CD69 and CD103 was remarkably similar between brain locations within individual donors (Figure 4B). PCA revealed a clear separation of blood and brain T cell samples as well as a tight clustering of subcortical WM and corpus callosum WM samples, in particular within donors, and, to a lesser extent, medulla samples, representing WM and GM (Figure 4C). The purity of the isolated cells was high (Figure 4D). CD69+ T cells from all three brain locations presented a TRM-cell core signature13 gene expression (Figures 4E and S7, Data S2) and expressed genes abundantly transcribed by brain TRM cells (SPP1, IL2, IL2RA, MS4A1, CCR2, and CCR5) at comparable levels (Figure 4F). There were relatively little DE genes, but WM versus medulla WM/GM samples showed most differences (Data S3). Our data indicate a high similarity between TRM cells in different brain regions and indicate that differences in maturity (CD103 expression) are directed by donor history rather than brain location.Figure 4Brain-regional characteristics of CD8+ CD69+ T cellsBulk RNA sequencing was performed of CD8+ CD69+ T cells from subcortical WM, corpus callosum WM, and medulla WM/GM from n = 3–5 brain donors (second dataset).(A) Representative dot plots showing the flow cytometry gating strategy used for obtaining the samples for RNA sequencing.(B) Percentage of CD8+ T cell subsets in the brain samples processed for RNA sequencing, determined by flow cytometry.(C) Expression of genes associated with T cells (CD3D, CD4, CD8A), B cells (CD19), microglia (P2RY12), astrocytes (AQP4), oligodendrocytes (MAG), and neurons (MAP2) in the sequenced samples, obtained by RNA sequencing.

T cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of MS, and we therefore isolated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from normal-appearing and lesional WM and GM of n = 6 deceased MS brain donors (Figure S8). CD69+ T cells were sorted and enabled bulk RNA sequencing of normal-appearing WM samples of all 6 donors and normal-appearing GM samples of 2 donors. T cell yield was generally higher in WM compared to GM. MS WM lesions contained n = 5 mixed active/inactive lesions and n = 1 inactive lesion. Again, about half of all CD8+ T cells but almost no CD4+ T cells in WM expressed CD103 (Figure 5A). PCA revealed clustering of all samples independent of their origin from MS lesional or normal-appearing WM and GM (Figure 5B), and the purity of the obtained T cell transcriptomes was confirmed (Figure 5C). In contrast, as in the non-MS samples, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells separated quite well.Figure 5Whole-transcriptome profiling of MS brain CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cellsBulk RNA sequencing was performed of CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells from MS normal-appearing and lesional WM and GM from n = 6 brain donors (third dataset).(A) Percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets in the brain samples processed for RNA sequencing, determined by flow cytometry.(B) Expression of genes associated with T cells (CD3D, CD4, CD8A), B cells (CD19), microglia (P2RY12), astrocytes (AQP4), oligodendrocytes (MAG), and neurons (MAP2) in the sequenced samples, obtained by RNA sequencing.

Gene expression was corrected for cell number and donor.

In a combined PCA of both datasets, we found co-clustering of all brain CD69+ T cells suggesting their similarity (Figure S9). In a comparison of TRM-cell core signature13 gene expression scaled within donors (in columns) across both experiments, CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells from MS WM and GM lesions were highly similar to cells from MS normal-appearing or non-MS WM and GM (Figure 5D). Differential gene expression analysis revealed a small number of DE genes in MS lesional and normal-appearing WM CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells (Figure 5E and Data S4).

Because genes associated with MS risk alleles have been postulated to reflect relevant biological pathways in the disease process of MS, which may be reflected in the TRM-cell expression profile, we also investigated their expression. There was no enrichment of genes associated with MS risk alleles20 in T cells from MS lesions compared to MS normal-appearing WM (Figure S10A and Data S5). There was also no enrichment of MS risk-associated gene expression in TEM(RA) or TRM cells, indicating that the T cell mediated risk of MS onset is not conveyed exclusively by any specific individual T cell subset (Figure S10B and Data S6). Functional enrichment was conversely present. Competitive gene set enrichment analysis (CAMERA) gene set enrichment analysis showed MS lesional WM CD8+ CD69+ T cells enriched ‘response to virus’, ‘tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle’, ‘post-translational modifications’, and ‘transcription/translation’ gene sets, whereas normal-appearing WM CD8+ CD69+ T cells displayed a trend of ‘acute inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus’ and ‘epithelial cell-cell adhesion’ gene sets (Figure S10C and Data S6). This observation could indicate an altered activation state of lesional T cells.

Although gene expression did not change at bulk level, functionally relevant subsets may have expanded or decreased in MS lesional compared to normal-appearing WM CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells (Figure S11). CD103 presence on brain CD8+ T cells correlates with reduced expression of differentiation markers, increased expression of tissue-homing chemokine receptors, increased expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4, and lower expression of CD20 and the cytolytic granzymes B and K.8,17 Conversely, intermediate presence of CD20 associates with higher expression of chemokine receptors and higher expression of granzymes B and K.15 The percentage of CD103+ and CD20+ brain T cells, measured by flow cytometry, did not differ between MS lesional and normal-appearing WM CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells (Figures 5A and 6A). In addition, expression of OPN, CD25, granzyme K, chemokine receptors, and inhibitory receptors on CD8+ CD69+ T cells stratified for CD20 or CD103 positivity did not differ between MS lesional and normal-appearing WM (Figures S12 and S13).Figure 6Functional characteristics of MS brain CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells(A) Percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated from non-MS WM and MS normal-appearing and lesional WM expressing CD103 and CD20, determined by flow cytometry.(B) Percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated from non-MS WM and MS normal-appearing and lesional WM expressing the TH1/17-associated molecules CD25, CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR5, and granzyme K, determined by flow cytometry.(C) Cytokine production by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated from non-MS WM and MS normal-appearing and lesional WM and stimulated for 4 h with PMA/ionomycin, determined by intracellular flow cytometry.

More recently, CD4+ T cells expressing CCR5, CCR6, CXCR5, or granzyme K and sharing characteristics of T-helper type 1/17 (TH1/17) cells have been shown to home specifically into the CNS of MS patients.21,22,23,24 We compared proportions of cells positive for CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR5, granzyme K, and CD25 between non-MS WM and MS normal-appearing and lesional WM CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells (Figures 6B and S4). In accordance with the gene expression data, we did not find a specific MS lesional enrichment of T cells positive for these markers.

To further explore potential functional differences, we stimulated lymphocytes derived from non-MS WM and MS normal-appearing and lesional WM ex vivo with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. Notably, intracellular staining of cytokines IL-2, TNF, and IFNγ showed decreased expression in MS lesional compared to normal-appearing MW CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells, with an increased proportion of cells producing neither of these cytokines (Figure 6C). In line with the reported polyfunctionality of brain T cells,8 cytokine-producing T cells were often triple-positive (IL-2+ TNF+ IFNγ+). The reduction of cytokine production did not coincide with a lower cell viability, as measured with Apotracker Green (Figure S14).

We hypothesized that this lack of cytokine production could be due to exhaustion of T cells residing in the local, presumably chronic inflammatory environment of mixed active/inactive MS lesions. However, in line with the gene expression data, protein expression of (combinations of) inhibitory receptors associated with T cell exhaustion did not differ between MS lesional and normal-appearing WM CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells25 (Figure 6D and S4, and data not shown). Accordingly, because CD8+ T cell exhaustion is also associated with enhanced granzyme B production,26 we previously found no increase in granzyme B expression by MS lesional compared to normal-appearing MW CD8+ T cells.17

Next, we hypothesized differences in tissue organization to determine cytokine production by MS lesional versus normal-appearing WM T cells. Because we here studied T cells obtained from active and mixed active/inactive MS lesions, these cells likely contained larger proportions originating from the parenchyma rather than the PVS.17 Applying immunohistochemistry for CD3, TNF, and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) to show the PVS border, we repeated this finding, as the proportion of T cells located in the parenchyma was significantly higher in MS active and mixed active/inactive lesional compared to inactive lesional and normal-appearing WM (Figures 6E and 6F). Further, we noted a lower percentage of TNF+ T cells in the parenchyma compared to the PVS in MS donors (Figure 6G). This finding supports earlier finding that the brain parenchyma provide anti-inflammatory signals,27 which can suppress T cell cytokine production.

The parenchyma provides an environment enriched for inhibitory signals, compared to the PVS.27 Accordingly, OPN has been reported to act as an immune checkpoint to suppress T cell activation.28SPP1 gene expression is upregulated in MS lesional tissue29 (Figure 7A), and various recent studies attributed this upregulation to microglia.30,31,32 We validated this in our donors with immunohistochemistry on protein level, as within sections, the OPN-positive area was higher in MS lesional compared to normal-appearing WM (Figures 7B and S15). RNA sequencing of n = 5 corresponding samples revealed higher gene expression of SPP1 in microglia compared to brain T cells (Figure 7C). The latter did not upregulate OPN production in MS lesions (Figures 7D and S11). By immunofluorescence staining of MS tissue, we again observed a high (68 ± 28%) percentage of T cells in contact with OPN, both in MS lesional as well as in normal-appearing WM T cells (Figure 7E). Focusing on parenchymal T cells, MS lesional T cells were more often associated with OPN compared to T cells in the normal-appearing WM (Figure 7F).Figure 7OPN expression in MS lesions(A) SPP1 gene expression in MS lesional compared to control WM.

Here, we provide evidence that human brain CD8+ and CD4+ T cells display a TRM-cell transcriptional profile characterized by the expression of SPP1 (OPN) and MS4A1 (CD20). Perivascular brain TRM cells showed a spatial association with OPN depositions, possibly controlling compartmentalization and activation of these cells. In MS lesional WM, brain CD8+ and CD4+ T cells retained their TRM-cell transcriptomic profile, showing few DE genes compared to normal-appearing WM and no common traits across groups. MS lesional expression and deposition of OPN was upregulated and associated with a reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by MS lesional brain TRM cells. This lowered cytokine production did not associate with an increased expression of inhibitory receptors and/or markers of exhaustion in MS lesional versus normal-appearing WM brain TRM cells. Altogether, our data indicate that brain T cells physiologically reside in a highly controlled environment, which limits their continuous contribution to pathological, focal inflammation within chronic MS lesions in the brain parenchyma. These setting may dictate approaches to control the contribution of these cells to early lesion development or expansion in progressive MS. Disease-modifying treatments thus far are of limited effectiveness in suppressing disability progression without relapses in progressive MS,33 and remyelination strategies have not been successful in clinical trials yet.34 An explanation could be the inability of these treatments to either reach or control focal, compartmentalized inflammatory processes in progressive MS. Local expression of OPN in addition to other regulatory molecules,27 may add to the control of brain-resident lymphocyte activation in the PVS and parenchyma of people with MS.

Previously, we showed with multi-color flow cytometry of viable brain lymphocyte fractions acquired with rapid postmortem autopsies that human WM is populated by CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells with a TRM-cell phenotypic profile.8,9,17 In our current work, we expand on these data, showing with bulk RNA sequencing that the brain WM and GM CD8+ and CD4+ T cell transcriptome harbors a core TRM-cell expression profile. Although this technique does not allow an analysis of phenotypical diversity of this brain T cell pool, it allows an in-depth characterization of the transcriptional features of brain-homing T cells. The gene set enrichment analysis supports a downregulation of non-TRM-cell associated gene sets with also an upregulation of TRM-cell associated genes. The direct comparison of the brain TRM cells with circulating TEM(RA) cells is likely influenced by unique characteristics of brain-resident T cells. Their phenotype shows similarities with T cells isolated from other tissues, such as lungs, skin, gut, and liver.10,13,14 The notable SPP1 gene activity seen by us in brain T cells is not a general trait of TRM cells13,35 but has been found before in T cells isolated from salivary glands,36 which may indicate that OPN production could be acquired by T cells in other tissues as well. Alternatively, high SPP1 expression has been identified as characteristic of senescence-associated T cells, which could point toward a chronically activated state of brain T cells.37 The expression of MS4A1 (CD20) by brain T cells could be a more unique feature of brain-homing T cells or cells associated with inflammatory diseases. Since the first detailed description of this cell type in MS by Palanichamy et al., CD20dim T cells attracted much attention.38 Our current findings corroborate our earlier work, showing an expanded proportion of CD20dim T cells among the brain CD8+ T cell fraction. We showed that brain CD20dim CD8+ T cells more abundantly express the chemokine receptor CXCR6, the activation marker Ki-67, and the lytic mediator granzyme B, compared to their CD20neg counterparts.15 Recent findings show that CD8+ memory T cell populations in MS CSF are characterized by high expression of CD69, granzyme K, and CD20, and could represent brain TRM-cell precursors.39 Furthermore, von Essen et al. showed previously that the proportion of CD20dim CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is enriched in CSF, compared to circulating T cells, that CD20dim T cell fractions can be found across differentiation stages (i.e. naive and memory cells), and that CD20dim T cells outside the CNS are also enriched in the expression of integrins and chemokine receptors (CD49d, CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR3), produce more abundantly pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNF, GM-CSF), and possess a higher responsiveness to myelin antigens (MOG/MBP).40 We show that several of these phenotypic characteristics are retained by brain CD20dim CD8+ and CD4+ TRM cells. The presence of CD20, as we currently show and previously showed with RT-qPCR,15 makes trogocytosis of CD20 on B–T cell interaction less likely as exclusive explanation for the existence of this cell population.41 The observation that MS therapies as rituximab and alemtuzumab deplete circulating CD20dim T cells38,40 suggests that these treatments may also affect long-term development and maintenance of these cells in the PVS. Accordingly, selective depletion of CD20dim T cells also ameliorates experimental models of neuroinflammation.41 Because we previously found CD20dim T cells enriched in MS tissue compared to control tissue,15 depletion of these cells could potentially explain effects of CD20-directed therapies on long-term disease progression.

Our current data show that increased SPP1 (OPN) expression is a generic key characteristic of brain TRM cells, in contrast to circulating TEM(RA)-cell fractions. Several CNS-resident cell populations have been shown to express OPN, such as microglia, neuronal cell bodies, and oligodendrocytes. In addition, OPN has previously been identified as a trait of CNS-homing lymphocytes and hematologic malignancies.42 This abundant expression of OPN across cell types suggests it as a constitutive element of cellular homeostasis and interaction within the CNS. OPN can be found in both an intracellular and a secreted form, the latter being processed by thrombin cleavage among other post-translational modifications.43 These different conformations of OPN mediate distinct biological functions as well as possibility to engage in molecular interaction with, among others, the integrin CD49d (VLA-4) and the scavenger receptor CD44. In this sense, both pro-and anti-inflammatory characteristics have been attributed to OPN, including a more pro-inflammatory role in T cell homeostasis and a more anti-inflammatory role in myeloid cell activation.44 However, recent work by Klement et al. suggests that OPN may also serve as a checkpoint inhibitor controlling local CD8+ T cell (re)activation.28

We think our data revisits the role of OPN in MS. Previously, soluble OPN levels have been shown to be upregulated in blood of people with relapsing MS45,46,47 and in CSF of people with progressive MS. Accordingly, Chabas et al. showed an upregulation of SPP1 transcription in association with MS lesions, and staining for OPN of microvascular endothelial cells, macrophages, astrocytes, and microglia in MS tissue.48 Sinclair et al. showed that this increased expression co-localizes with demyelination and microglial activation.49 Acknowledging the role of OPN as a pro-inflammatory T cell cytokine, Chabas et al. showed in Spp1-knockout mice a reduction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) severity and chronicity.48 However, the EAE model depends on a profound recruitment of auto-reactive T cells from secondary lymphoid organs, which is likely much more dependent on immune regulatory processes outside the CNS, compared to the local inflammatory process of advanced MS. In Spp1-knockout mice, circulating T cells showed reduced proliferation and IFNγ production together with an increase in IL-10 expression, ultimately culminating in reduced severity of disease within the CNS.48 The data of Klement et al. warrant a reappraisal of OPN in advanced MS.28 We previously showed that brain CD8+ TRM cells in MS lesions upregulate expression of CD44,17 and now we demonstrate that MS lesional T cells retain expression of OPN, that brain T cells spatially distribute in close contact with these OPN depositions, and that OPN expression and deposition are increased in MS lesions. The source of these depositions could be T cells, but also microglia, which we show here to contain much higher levels of SPP1 transcripts. MS-associated microglia further upregulate SPP1 gene activity,30,31,32 and OPN has been identified as a chemoattractant for both myeloid and T cell populations.44 Whether these OPN depositions contribute to a more anti-inflammatory milieu in chronic MS lesions, culminating directly or indirectly in a reduced cytokine response of T cells, remains to be further studied. Therefore, increased local OPN expression in advanced MS could be regarded as a compensatory anti-inflammatory process, rather than a detrimental pro-inflammatory T cell cytokine response. This notion could offer new approaches to study the role of OPN in the local control of inflammation. In addition to this, enhancement of remyelination and neuroregeneration by OPN has also been suggested in experimental models of demyelination.50

Because we observed few DE genes in MS lesional versus normal-appearing WM brain TRM cells, our previously hypothesized relevance of these cells for progressive MS can be disputed.51 Accordingly, disease-modifying therapies affecting peripheral T cell homeostasis have a limited effect on progressive MS, and T cell-associated risk genes are primarily associated with the risk of developing MS,20 while their association with MS progression is currently under investigation. However, there are several alternative hypotheses to consider. First, we studied T cells in chronic mixed active/inactive lesions, while these cells may rather contribute to MS lesion formation or expansion in surrounding normal-appearing WM. We previously showed changes in microglial gene expression in normal-appearing WM surrounding MS lesions,29 suggesting cellular changes are already taking place. Brain TRM cells from these regions were not studied in our current project. Second, discrete sub-populations of brain TRM cells could contribute to MS lesion formation, which remain hidden in the total brain T cell transcriptome obtained by our bulk RNA sequencing approach. Previously, Van Langelaar et al. showed that circulating CD4+ T cells with a high expression of CCR6 (Th17.1 cells) have a higher propensity to be recruited to the CNS of people with MS and are preferentially retained in the circulation by natalizumab treatment.21 Recently, Kaufman et al. showed that natalizumab-treatment results in a CD161+ CD4+ T cell population with several similar characteristics being retained in the circulation, and that low-frequent hits of cells with a similar transcriptome could be revealed with spatial RNA sequencing among local T cell infiltrates in chronic MS.23 Accordingly, Herich et al. also showed that granzyme K+ CCR5+ CD4+ T cell fractions can be isolated from resected WM samples of donors being treated with epilepsy surgery, and that these cells are clonally expanded in the circulation of people with MS.22 Regarding CD8+ T cells, Beltrán et al. showed that in CSF of twins discordant for MS, CD8+ T cell fractions with a TRM-cell like profile were clonally expanded in the CSF of the twin without MS.18 Such small sub-populations may have remained under the radar in our current study. However, it also remains to be seen whether a phenotypic or transcriptomic profile of circulating T cell clones is preserved in T cells entering and residing in tissue. A paired analysis of TCR clones and phenotypes in several compartments (i.e., circulation, CSF, tissue) could bridge these gaps. Third, we may encounter cells that have contributed to lesion progression in MS, but are in end-stage MS in an exhausted state. Exhausted CD8+ T cells are characterized by impaired cytokine production (most notably IL-2), retained lytic enzyme expression, and co-expression of by itself nonspecific inhibitory receptors.52 We could not find an increased co-expression of inhibitory receptors in the brain TRM-cell transcriptome. And although we could demonstrate with flow cytometry sub-populations of PD-1+CD39+ T cells within MS normal-appearing and control WM, these were not enriched in MS lesions, did not express markers as CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3, and did not account for the increased proportion of cells not producing cytokines in MS lesions. Therefore, these cells do not display at least a fully exhausted phenotype. Fourth, Machado-Santos et al. hypothesized that T cells may contribute to lesion formation and progression in MS rather by making pro-inflammatory mediators from the PVS.16 We previously showed that a substantial proportion of MS lesional T cells leaves the PVS and enters the brain parenchyma in MS, where inhibitory receptors on these cells may encounter their ligands, such as PD-L18 and, as discussed above, possibly also OPN. Our data now show that lesional WM T cells exhibit functional enrichments related to cell damage and repair, whereas normal-appearing WM-associated T cells associate with more pro-inflammatory gene sets, such as cell–cell contact and response to antigenic stimulation. This observation provides further support for the PVS as immunogenic compartment compared to the highly controlled environment of the brain parenchyma.2 Taken together, a mix of activated perivascular and controlled parenchymal T cells could dilute DE genes within the bulk transcriptome.

In sum, we here provide a detailed characterization of the phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional profile of brain CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, which will help to understand their role in physiological immune surveillance of the CNS, but also in pathological conditions. Our data suggest an important role of OPN in the control and compartmentalization of brain T cells, which should be investigated further for the benefit of people with advanced MS.

Limitations of the current study are first the analysis of postmortem tissue of elderly human brain donors with advanced MS. The direct applicability of our data on donors earlier in their disease course remains not entirely certain,17 yet Beltrán et al. described CD8+ TRM-like cells in the CSF during possibly the earliest stages of MS in MS discordant twins.18 In addition, our data provide most information on the disease process in advanced progressive MS of which treatment is an unmet clinical need. Second, we show associations between disease status and brain T cell characteristics, yet do not provide functional or mechanistic studies. Also, direct comparisons cannot be made between the MS and control datasets because biological differences are confounded with possible technical differences between the two batches. Third, we studied the bulk transcriptome of brain T cells, in which relevant (clonally expanded) T cell subsets are likely hidden,53,54 which could be revealed with techniques as single-cell or single-nuclear RNA sequencing. Nevertheless, bulk RNA sequencing provides the most deep and profound characterization of the T cell transcriptome, and potential sub-populations were in the current study addressed with flow cytometry. The strengths of this study are the unique analysis of viable T cells from human brain tissue of a large sample of postmortem brain donors, the deep transcriptional profiling of these cells, and the combination of different techniques as RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to study the characteristics of brain T cells.

Human brain tissues and blood were provided by the Netherlands Brain Bank (Amsterdam, The Netherlands; https://www.brainbank.nl). Informed consent for performing autopsy and using tissue and clinical data for research purposes was obtained from brain donors and approved by the Ethics Committee of Amsterdam UMC (Location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

White matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissue blocks were collected from corpus callosum (n = 11) and occipital cortex (n = 11) (first dataset) as well as from subcortex (n = 5), corpus callosum (n = 3), and medulla (n = 4) (second dataset), respectively. Normal-appearing WM (n = 6), normal-appearing GM (n = 6), lesional WM (n = 5), and lesional GM (n = 2) tissue blocks of MS donors were dissected at autopsy on post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging guidance69 (third dataset).

Neurological diagnosis was confirmed post-mortem by a neuropathologist, based on both clinical and pathological data. Non-neurological control donors with cognitive problems, based on clinical data, were excluded from the analysis. Brain donor characteristics are displayed below.Brain donors and sample information for RNA sequencingBrain donorDiagnosisTissueSexAge (years)PMD (h:min)pH CSFBrain weight (g)Cause of death1MSCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF636:056.51130Ceased oral intake2MDDCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF728:456.51265Legal euthanasia3HCCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF1024:556.71100Old age4MSACC WM, OCC GM, bloodM558:006.61535Multiple system atrophy5HCCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF988:456.31010Heart failure6PDCC WM, OCC GM, bloodM617:006.61,485Possible aspiration7PDCC WM, OCC GM, bloodM654:507.61350Respiratory insufficiency8FTDCC WM, OCC GM, bloodM495:056.31105Dehydration and cachexia9ADCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF945:356.2930General deterioration, dehydration, and ceased oral intake10HCCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF796:006.81075Lung cancer11ADCC WM, OCC GM, bloodF945:106.41155Lung cancer12FTDSub WM, CC WM, Medulla WM and GMM665:506.51385Myocardial infarction13NarcoSub WM, CC WM, Medulla WM and GMM755:496.61246Euthanasia14FTDSub WM, Medulla WM and GMM694:556.61306Myocardial infarction15ADSub WM, Medulla WM and GMM755:406.61211Ceased oral intake, palliative sedation16FTDSub WM, CC WM, Medulla WM and GMM736:406.01269Cardiac arrest17MSNAWM, NAGM, lesional WMM735:406.31270Legal euthanasia18MSNAWM, NAGM, lesional WMF665:406.51160N/A19MSNAWM, lesional WMF616:256.21055Wound infection and pneumonia20MSNAWM, NAGM, lesional WMM858:456.91235Legal euthanasia21MSNAWM, NAGM, lesional WM, lesional GMF716:206.71335Legal euthanasia22MSNAWM, NAGM, lesional WM, lesional GMF668:006.31305PneumoniaSamples 1 to 11, 12 to 16, and 17 to 22 refer to the three datasets of this study.

Brain tissue blocks of 4–6 g were dissected at autopsy and stored in a 50-mL tube containing 25 mL Hibernate A medium at 4°C until further processing. Mononuclear cells were isolated as described before.70 Brain tissue was put in a 10-cm petri dish with Hibernate A medium, and large vessels and membranes were removed. WM tissue was chopped into little chunks using two scalpels (Sigma-Aldrich). GM tissue was grinded over a 100-mesh tissue sieve (Sigma-Aldrich) with a plunger from a 50-mL disposable syringe. Tissue chunks were pipetted into a 50-mL tube, followed by enzymatic digestion with 300 U/mL collagenase I (for RNA sequencing samples) or 300 U/mL collagenase IV (for flow-cytometric samples) in Hibernate A medium supplemented with 33 μg/mL DNAse I for 60 min in a water bath at 37°C. Every 15 min, the tubes were vortexed. After incubation, the cell suspensions were filtered through a clean 100-mesh tissue sieve into a 10-cm petri dish, collected in 50-mL tubes, and filled up to 50 mL with cold DMEM medium (450 mL DMEM without phenol, 50 mL fetal bovine serum, and 5 mL penicillin G and streptomycin mix). The tubes were centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, after which the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were resuspended in ∼15 mL cold DMEM medium, resulting in cell suspensions in a final volume of 20 mL. 10 mL cold Percoll was slowly dripped directly on the cell suspensions after which the tubes were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C with the acceleration set at 5 and the brake set at 4. Three layers were obtained with myelin at the top, erythrocytes at the bottom, and mononuclear cells in between. Mononuclear cells were collected from the interlayer into a 50-mL tube using a glass pipette (after the myelin had either been removed with a pipette or pushed carefully aside). Cells were washed by filling up the tube with cold DMEM medium followed by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. In parallel with collecting the brain tissue, 5 mL peripheral blood was collected by cardiac puncture from the deceased donors and stored in a Vacutainer EDTA tube (BD) at room temperature. Mononuclear cells were isolated using Lymphoprep according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Erythrocytes in cell suspensions of mononuclear cells from brain and peripheral blood were removed by erythrocyte lysis buffer, and cells were wash twice by cold DMEM medium.

Blood CD8+ and CD4+ CCR7−CD45RA− effector memory T (TEM) and CCR7−CD45RA+ effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T (TEMRA) cells and brain CD8+ and CD4+ CD69+ T cells were sorted on a BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) (for staining procedure see below). Gating strategies are shown in Figure S1. Sorted cells were lysed in 350 μL buffer RLT plus 1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at −80°C until further processing. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy MicroKit according to the manufacturers’ instructions, and RNA sequencing was performed in three batches (GenomeScan). All RNA samples were polyA-enriched and then sequenced with a 150-bp paired-end read length on a NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina).Specification of antibodies used for sorting of blood mononuclear cellsAntigenCompanyCloneDilutionFluorochromeCD3eBioscienceSK71:250PEcy5.5CD4BD BiosciencesRPA-T41:50Alexa Fluor 700CD8BioLegendRPA-T81:500BV421CD45RABioLegendHI1001:250BV650CD197/CCR7BD Biosciences3D121:10PEcy7LIVE/DEAD Fixable Viability DyeeBioscience1:1000eFluor 780Specification of antibodies used for sorting of brain mononuclear cellsAntigenCompanyCloneDilutionFluorochromeCD3eBioscienceSK71:250PEcy5.5CD4BD BiosciencesRPA-T41:50Alexa Fluor 700CD8BioLegendRPA-T81:500BV421CD69BioLegendFN501:100BV650CD103eBioscienceB-Ly71:50PELIVE/DEAD Fixable Viability DyeeBioscience1:1000eFluor 780

Single-cell suspensions were blocked with FcR Blocking Reagent and stained with cocktails of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in PBS supplemented with 1% fetal bovine albumin. Intracellular staining was performed using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation and Permeabilization Solution kit for the detection of cytokines.

Sections were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was performed in a microwave at 700 W for 10 min in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 and 0.2% Triton-X in Tris-buffered saline, and sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies.Specification of antibodies and procedures for immunohistochemistryAntigenCompanyProductHostClonalityCloneDilutionTissue fixationAntigen retrieval methodCD3DAKOA0452rabbitpoly1:100FFPETris-EDTA pH 9.0OPNSanta Cruzsc-21742mousemonoAKm2A11:50FFPETris-EDTA pH 9.0TNFProteintech60291-1mousemono7B8A111:500FFPETris-EDTA pH 9.0GFAPSanta Cruzsc-6170goatpoly1:200FFPETris-EDTA pH 9.0FFPE: formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, mono: monoclonal, poly: polyclonal.

Subsequently, sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse (1:400), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey-anti-goat (1:400) and Cy3-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit (1:400) antibodies followed by ABC (Avidin-Biotin-Complex) Kit incubation. TNF sections were then incubated for 45 min with streptavidin-Cy5 (1:600) and osteopontin (OPN) sections with biotinylated tyramide (1:10,000 in PBS with 0.001% H2O2) for 10 min and with streptavidin-Cy5 (1:600) for 45 min sequentially. For all sections, a final incubation with Hoechst for 10 min was performed. Negative controls with discard of primary antibody were included. Pictures at 40× and 63× magnification were taken using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope and Application Suite X (Leica). From the same tissue blocks, OPN was stained in the same fashion as described above using the ABC kit followed by incubation with 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen for 10 min. No counterstain was performed. Images were acquired using the Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 (Carl Zeiss AG) (Figure S15).

To assess intracellular cytokine production, cells were stimulated for 4 h with 10 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 1 μg/mL ionomycin in the presence of 10 μg/mL brefeldin A, 5 μg/mL monensin, 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 (15E8), and 1 μg/mL anti-CD29 (TS2/16). Detection of intracellular cytokines was performed following earlier published procedures.8 Cells were stained with antibodies for surface markers and with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 for 30 min at 4°C. Subsequently, cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized, using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation and Permeabilization Solution kit, followed by intracellular staining with antibodies.

Quality control was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.9). Adapter sequences were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.39), and additional trimming using fastp (version 0.23.2) was performed in the second dataset. Reads were mapped to the human GRCh38 genome using HISAT2 (version 2.2.1)57 on default settings. Feature counts of reads mapped to genes were determined using HTSeq (first and third datasets: version 1.99.2; second dataset: version 2.0.2) with the ‘Homo_sapiens.CRCh38.105.gtf’ file (options:-m union-f bam-r name-s no-a 10-t exon-i gene_id).64

Resulting counts of all datasets were analyzed separately using R (version 4.2.0) and Bioconductor (version 3.15). In the first dataset, two samples were removed from analysis (one blood CD4+ TEMRA and one WM CD4+ CD69+ T cells). The blood CD4+ TEMRA-cell sample was removed due to small library size (2824565). The WM CD4+ CD69+ T-cell sample was removed due to a low cell number input (1176) in combination with an unusually low normalization factor (0.74) and low expression of sample hallmark gene CD4. In the second dataset, three samples were removed from analysis based on initial PCA. Two samples (one CD8+ medulla T cells and one CD8+ subcortical WM T cells) had an aberrant library prep, and one sample (CD8+ medulla T cells) contained the lowest input cell number. Plots were not corrected for effects relating to input, as this was related to experimental groups. Initial data exploration was performed using both microglia and T-cell data, afterwards, T-cell data were subsetted, normalized again and used for further analysis. Based on an initial principal component analysis (PCA), one sample was also removed from the third dataset. This sample (CD4+ normal-appearing GM T cells) contained a low cell number (546) used for sequencing analysis. Genes with more than 2 counts in a minimum of 4 (first dataset) or 2 (second and third datasets) samples were retained. Count data were transformed to log2-counts per million (logCPM), normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method (edgeR package, version 3.37.4),59 and precision weighted using voom (limma package, version 3.51.8).65 The remaining genes (first dataset 1: 23,712, second dataset: 22,632, and third dataset: 24,077) were reannotated with the biomaRt package (version 2.51.4),57 using Ensembl (version 106). PCA was performed on the logCPM values of the 500 most variable genes to distinguish sources of variation using the PCAtools package (version 2.8.0). In the first and third datasets, the first principal component was strongly correlated with the log10-transformed cell number counts. Therefore, principal component plots were made after correction for this covariate and donor variation, using the function removeBatchEffect (limma package). Plots in which the first and third datasets are shown were generated using a merged dataset, which was obtained by combining the raw counts and applying filtering and normalization as described above. Gene expression values were corrected for cell number and donor effects using the limma package.

Differential expression was assessed using an empirical Bayes moderated t-test within limma’s linear model framework71 including donor and log10-transformed cell number counts as covariates [Y = ∼0 + experimental condition + donor + log10 (cell number)]. In the second dataset, differential expression was only assessed of T cells. Resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR). Genes with FDR <0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed. Expression of SPP1 by microglia and T cells was quantified on the same data as the original exploration and tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test in GraphPad Prism. Results were visualized with the ggplot2 package (version 3.3.5).62

Competitive gene set enrichment analysis was performed with CAMERA72 with preset value of 0.01 for the inter-gene correlation using the Hallmark, C1, C2, C3, C5, C6, and C7 gene set collections retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, version 7.0; https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp),68 TRM-cell core signature13 and MS risk allele gene sets20 were added manually. CAMERA results were visualized using Cytoscape (version 3.9.0) with the EnrichmentMap (version 3.3.3) plugin58,60 with a cutoff of FDR <0.1 and a minimum of 5 gene sets per network. The less conservative criterion was chosen to create a less sparse network. Networks were portioned into modules and annotated using the AutoAnnotate (version 1.3.5) plugin and manual curation.

For immunohistochemical quantification of OPN+ CD3+ cells, images of CD3+ cell clusters were taken at 40× magnification. Data were then analyzed using QuPath 0.2.3.66 Cell detection was run using StarDist.73 CD3+ cells were classified using a QuPath-integrated random trees object classifier. OPN+ and TNF+ cells were classified using a single measurement classifier with a threshold mean cell intensity of 2.5 (OPN, control tissue) or 6.0 (OPN, MS tissue) and 12.5 (TNF, MS tissue), respectively.

Regions-of-interest were annotated with holes and tissue inconsistencies excluded. OPN-positive area was established through a pixel thresholder including a Laplacian of Gaussian prefilter. Statistical analyses of all image quantifications were performed in R (version 4.0.2) using a mixed model approach including donor as a random factor through the ‘lme4’ (version 1.1-29) and ‘emmeans’ (version 1.8.0) packages. Graphs were visualized using GraphPad Prism.
