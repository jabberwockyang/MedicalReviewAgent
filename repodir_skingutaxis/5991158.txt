Comprehensive Expression Profiling of Highly Homologous 39 Hox Genes in 26 Different Human Adult Tissues by the Modified Systematic Multiplex RT-PCR Method Reveals Tissue-Specific Expression Pattern That Suggests an Important Role of Chromosomal Structure in the Regulation of Hox Gene Expression in Adult Tissues

Homeobox genes play a crucial role as molecular address labels in early embryogenesis by conferring cell fate and establishing regional identity in tissues. Homeobox gene expression is not restricted to the early development, but it is also observed in the differentiated cells in adult tissues. To have a better understanding of the functionality of homeobox gene expression in adult tissues in physiological and pathological phenomena, it is important to determine the expression profiles of Hox genes. We established a system to study the expression of 39 human Hox genes by the modified Systematic Multiplex RT-PCR method. Using this system, we have systematically examined their expression in 26 different adult tissues. The results showed tissue-specific differential expression. They also revealed that the posterior tissues generally express more Hox genes than the anterior tissues and that the genes located centrally in the Hox Gene Complexes are expressed in more tissues than the genes located at the 5′ or 3′ end of the complexes. Instead of similar expression patterns among paralogous genes, we found that several neighboring Hox genes on the same chromosomes exhibited similar tissue-specific expression pattern, which may suggest that the regulation of Hox gene expression may be more dependent on chromosomal structure in adult tissues.
