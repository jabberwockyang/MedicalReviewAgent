Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have the potential to decrease transplant-related morbidity and mortality. However, engraftment failure has been prohibitively high after RIC unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in chemotherapy-naïve children with non-malignant diseases (NMD). Twenty-two children with a median age of 2.8 years, many with severe comorbidities and prior viral infections were enrolled in a novel RIC protocol consisting of hydroxyurea, alemtuzumab, fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa followed by single UCBT. Patients were transplanted for inherited metabolic disorders (N=8), primary immunodeficiencies (N=9), hemoglobinopathies (N=4) and Diamond Blackfan anemia (N=1). Most UCB units were HLA-mismatched with median infused total nucleated cell dose of 7.9 × 107/kg. No serious organ toxicities were attributable to the regimen. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 86.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65%–100%) in a median of 20 days, with the majority sustaining >95% donor chimerism at 1 year. Cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II–IV and III–IV by day 180 was 27.3% (95% CI, 8.7%–45.9%) and 13.6% (95 CI, 0%–27.6%), respectively. Cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 9.1% (95% CI, 0%–20.8%). The primary causes of death were viral infections (N=3), acute GVHD (N=1) and transfusion reaction (N=1). One-year overall and event-free survivals were 77.3% (95% CI, 53.7%–89.8%) and 68.2% (95% CI, 44.6%–83.4%) with 31 months median follow-up. This is the first RIC protocol demonstrating durable UCB engraftment in children with NMD. Future risk-based modifications of this regimen could decrease the incidence of viral infections.
