Schematic drawing of the basic "tissue control unit," which consists of monocyte-derived cells (marked M in the figure), vascular pericytes (P), and autonomic innervation (AI, dashed arrow), and the involvement of other components of the tissue control system (solid arrows).

Cytokine synthesis and apoptosis by intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes: signaling of high density alpha beta T cell receptor+ and gamma delta T cell receptor+ T cells via T cell receptor-CD3 complex results in interferon-gamma and interleukin-5 production, while low density T cells undergo DNA fragmentation
