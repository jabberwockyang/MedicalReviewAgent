The human body is populated by a large number of microorganisms and exist in symbiosis with these immensely diverse communities, which are suggested to influence health and disease. The microbiota plays an essential role in the maturation and function of the immune system. The prevalence of atopic diseases has increased drastically over the past decades, and the co‐occurrence of multiple allergic diseases and allergic sensitization starting in early life has gained a great deal of attention. Immune responses in different organs affected by allergic diseases (e.g. skin, intestine and lung) may be linked to microbial changes in peripheral tissues. In the current review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of microbial interactions in allergic diseases and their potential role in the atopic march.
