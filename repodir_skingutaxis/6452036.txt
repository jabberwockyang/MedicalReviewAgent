For many organisms, shapes emerge from growth, which generates stresses, which in turn can feedback on growth. In this review, theoretical methods to analyse various aspects of morphogenesis are discussed with the aim to determine the most adapted method for tissue mechanics. We discuss the need to work at scales intermediate between cells and tissues and emphasize the use of finite elasticity for this. We detail the application of these ideas to four systems: active cells embedded in tissues, brain cortical convolutions, the cortex of Caenorhabditis elegans during elongation and finally the proliferation of epithelia on extracellular matrix. Numerical models well adapted to inhomogeneities are also presented.
