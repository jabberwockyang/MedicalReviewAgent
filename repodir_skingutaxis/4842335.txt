Human limbal palisades of Vogt are the ideal site for studying and practicing regenerative medicine due to their accessibility. Nonresolving inflammation in limbal stroma is common manifestation of limbal stem cell (SC) deficiency and presents as a threat to the success of transplanted limbal epithelial SCs. This pathologic process can be overcome by transplantation of cryopreserved human amniotic membrane (AM), which exerts anti-inflammatory, antiscarring and anti-angiogenic action to promote wound healing. To determine how AM might exert anti-inflammation and promote regeneration, we have purified a novel matrix, HC-HA/PTX3, responsible for the efficacy of AM efficacy. HC-HA complex is covalently formed by hyaluronan (HA) and heavy chain 1 (HC1) of inter-Î±-trypsin inhibitor by the catalytic action of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) and are tightly associated with pentraxin 3 (PTX3) to form HC-HA/PTX3. In vitro reconstitution of the limbal niche can be established by reunion between limbal epithelial progenitors and limbal niche cells on different substrates. In 3-dimensional Matrigel, clonal expansion indicative of SC renewal is correlated with activation of canonical Wnt signaling and suppression of canonical BMP signaling. In contrast, SC quiescence can be achieved in HC-HA/PTX3 by activation of canonical BMP signaling and non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) Wnt signaling, but suppression of canonical Wnt signaling. HC-HA/PTX3 is a novel matrix mitigating nonresolving inflammation and restoring SC quiescence in the niche for various applications in regenerative medicine.
