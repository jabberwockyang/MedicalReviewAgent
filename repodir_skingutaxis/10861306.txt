Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately about 20% in developed countries1. It is a disease of early childhood with approximately 80%–90% of cases manifesting prior to the age of 623. Children with AD often develop other atopic disease, including food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma, in a stepwise fashion termed the atopic march4. Elucidating the mechanisms of atopic march progression has been of interest in recent years. Evidence exists supporting a “skin-gut-lung axis” in which epithelial barrier dysfunction in the skin, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tract connect dysbiosis-dependent immune dysregulation, predisposing to development and progression of the atopic march5. There are distinct microbial communities in the human skin, gut, and respiratory tract, all of which have been associated with distinct parameters in patients with AD6. In this study, we evaluate the microbiome at various mucosal sites in children with AD and compare it to children without AD, with further investigation into the influence of parental and neonatal factors on the microbiome.

Participants were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Children’s Center Allergy Clinic between 2019 and 2020. Inclusion criteria for patients included children less than or equal to 2 years of age with provider diagnosed AD and an ability to enroll their mothers. Controls were age-matched children with no history of AD. Exclusion criteria included systemic immunosuppression or oral antibiotic use at the time of enrollment. Mothers provided informed consent for enrollment on behalf of the child. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB# 18-008552). A total of 24 patients (16 patients with AD and 8 patients without AD) were enrolled along with their mothers. Baseline demographics are presented in Table 1. Samples were collected from the skin (unaffected ears), oral cavity, nasal cavity, and gastrointestinal tract. Following DNA isolation, taxonomy assignment, and data cleaning, four α-diversity metrics (amplicon sequence variant richness, Chao1 index, Shannon index, and Inverse Simpson index) were calculated. Site-specific microbiome differences based on AD status, the association of AD risk factors and microbiota, and the effect of maternal history on microbiota were all analyzed as a function of alpha, beta, and taxa diversity. Associations of alpha diversity with the variables of interest were determined using linear models. Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) were used to test for an association between variables of interest and the overall microbiota composition. Differences in individual taxa between groups were assessed using a permutation-based approach based on the F-statistics of a linear model and residual permutation was used to account for potential confounders. False discovery rate (FDR) control (B-H procedure) was used to correct for multiple testing at each taxonomic level, and FDR-adjusted p-values or q-values <0.10 were considered significant.

A total of 132 samples were sequenced for 16SrRNA. After data filtering, decontamination, and quality control, 80 samples were included in the analysis with 4,103,243 reads used after quality control. The most prominent phyla included Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria.

Dysbiotic oral microbiota was observed based on a significant decrease in alpha diversity in AD patients compared to non-AD patients (Shannon p<0.02, Inverse Simpson p<0.07, Fig. 1A). No significant difference in beta diversity between AD patients and controls was observed. There was a significant association between age and the oral microbiome (p=0.01), though no significant associations with sex, body mass index (BMI), or race were observed (Fig. 1B). Subjects with a maternal history of AD had a higher alpha diversity and a higher abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria. However, an opposite trend was observed in subjects with a paternal AD history where lower alpha diversity and a lower abundance of the phylum Patescibacteria was observed. Subjects born via C-section showed a greater abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria, family Neisseriaceae, class Betaproteobacteriales, and genus Neisseria. However, alpha and beta diversity were similar between the groups. Other maternal factors including BMI, antibiotic use during pregnancy, and GBS status did not impact the oral microbial composition.

No association between AD and the fecal microbiome was observed. Age, BMI, and sex of the subjects with AD did not show any correlation with fecal microbiome. However, when subjects were stratified based on parental history, differences were observed between subjects with AD compared to without AD. Presence of maternal atopic history was associated with reduced beta diversity, and two families of the phylum Firmicutes (Peptostreptococcaceae and Ruminococcaceae) were less abundant in AD subjects compared to without AD. There was no significant association between the cutaneous microbiome and AD status, or any parental factors evaluated.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of the microbiome of multiple anatomic sites in patients with AD. Previous studies have demonstrated site-specific reductions in microbiome diversity in patients with AD67. These changes may be interrelated in the progression of the atopic march, but the mechanism of these relationships is still being elucidated. Our data suggests alterations in the oral microbiome is associated with AD status as well as with parental history of AD and maternal life events. Previous studies have shown that the microbiome of healthy lungs is primarily composed of microbes from the oral cavity89. A longitudinal follow up of the oral microbiome in patients with AD could help determine the risk of developing asthma, which may promote more aggressive treatment of AD early in its course.

A weakness of this study is its small sample size, which decreases the strength of statistical analysis of sequencing data. This likely increases interpersonal variability, limiting the ability to detect differences in microbiome composition between groups. Additionally, we did not discover significant differences in the cutaneous microbiome in cases compared to controls. Sampling of lesional skin or multiple skin sites may have increased our ability to detect differences in microbial diversity between groups.

In summary, we have shown microbial alterations at various mucosal sites in patients with AD compared to those without, although the significance of these findings remains unclear. Longitudinal and functional studies will be needed to determine if these changes could be used to predict development of atopic disease.
