SUCNR1 is a sensor of extracellular succinate, a Krebs cycle intermediate generated in excess during oxidative stress and has been linked to metabolic regulation and inflammation. While mast cells express SUCNR1, its role in mast cell reactivity and allergic conditions such as asthma remains to be elucidated.

Cord blood‐derived mast cells and human mast cell line LAD‐2 challenged by SUCNR1 ligands were analyzed for the activation and mediator release. Effects on mast cell‐dependent bronchoconstriction were assessed in guinea pig trachea and isolated human small bronchi challenged with antigen and anti‐IgE, respectively.

SUCNR1 is abundantly expressed on human mast cells. Challenge with succinate, or the synthetic non‐metabolite agonist cis‐epoxysuccinate, renders mast cells hypersensitive to IgE‐dependent activation, resulting in augmented degranulation and histamine release, de novo biosynthesis of eicosanoids and cytokine secretion. The succinate‐potentiated mast cell reactivity was attenuated by SUCNR1 knockdown and selective SUCNR1 antagonists and could be tuned by pharmacologically targeting protein kinase C and extracellular signal‐regulated kinase. Both succinate and cis‐epoxysuccinate dose‐dependently potentiated antigen‐induced contraction in a mast cell‐dependent guinea pig airway model, associated with increased generation of cysteinyl‐leukotrienes and histamine in trachea. Similarly, cis‐epoxysuccinate aggravated IgE‐receptor‐induced contraction of human bronchi, which was blocked by SUCNR1 antagonism.

This study analyses cord‐blood derived mast cells and human mast cell line LAD‐2 challenged by SUCNR1 ligands for activation and mediator release. Succinate challenge or cis‐epoxysuccinate challenge renders mast cells hypersensitive to IgE‐dependent activation, resulting in augmented degranulation and histamine release, de novo biosynthesis of eicosanoids and cytokine secretion. The succinate‐potentiated mast cell reactivity is attenuated by SUCNR1 knockdown and selective SUCNR1 antagonists and could be tuned by pharmacologically targeting protein kinase C and extracellular signal‐regulated kinase.

Typically, mast cells are activated by FcεRI crosslinking, which is induced by multivalent antigens; however, these cells can also be primed or functionally modulated by cytokines, growth factors, toll‐like receptor ligands and G protein‐coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands (e.g., β‐2‐adrenergic agonists, eicosanoids).

Degranulation and immediate release of pre‐formed mediators, such as histamine, are hallmarks of mast cell activation, which are usually followed by de novo biosynthesis of eicosanoids and subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. These temporal actions of mast cells direct a series of secondary reactions in surrounding cells and tissues that will orchestrate and propagate the inflammatory response.

A range of endogenous metabolites including fatty acids, ketone bodies, and amino acids signal through GPCRs and recently, some of these receptors were found to be expressed on immune cells, thus offering distinct and potentially druggable molecular links between intermediary metabolism and the immune system.

Our work began with screening of human mast cells for expression of a range of metabolite receptors, which revealed very high levels of SUCNR1. The expression of this receptor in mast cells was reported, and mice deficient in SUCNR1 were subjected to mast cell related disease models with varying and unexpected outcomes.

While absence of the receptor reduced arthritis, markers of asthma were unaffected and, surprisingly, dermatitis aggravated. To gain further insights to the role of SUCNR1 in human mast cell reactivity and allergic asthma, we examined effects of specific receptor agonists and antagonists in isolated human mast cells and in guinea pig and human ex vivo models of mast cell‐dependent bronchoconstriction.

The human mast cell line LAD‐2 (kindly provided by Drs. A. Kirshenbaum and D. Metcalfe, NIH, Bethesda, MD) was maintained in StemPro‐34 SFM medium (Sigma‐Aldrich) supplemented with 100 ng/ml human stem cell factor (hSCF, kindly provided by Sobi, Stockholm, Sweden).

CBMC were incubated with 10 ng/ml IL‐4 prior to FcεRI crosslinking. For IgE sensitization, 1 µg/ml human IgE (Calbiochem, Minneapolis, MN) was added to CBMC or LAD‐2 at 24 h before FcεRI crosslinking, which was carried out with anti‐IgE antibody (0.4 µg/ml for CBMC and 100 µg/ml for LAD‐2 cells for 30 min, if not mentioned) (Sigma‐Aldrich). Calcium ionophore A23187 (2 µM, Sigma‐Aldrich) was used as a positive control for activation. The concentrations of both succinate and cES were 1 mM and both were added 30 min before anti‐IgE challenge unless otherwise specified.

Macroscopically, healthy human lung tissue was collected after consent from patients undergoing lobectomy (n = 7, 4 female and 3 male; median 70 years, range: 60–75 years; (Table S1). After resection, the specimens were immediately put in ice‐cold Krebs‐Ringer PSS buffer solution supplemented with 2.5 mM calcium chloride and 2.1 g/L sodium bicarbonate. Within 1 h, isolated bronchial rings with an inner diameter between 0.5 and 2 mm were dissected under microscope and maintained as previously described.

Our study began with screening of human mast cells for a range of metabolite receptors, which revealed moderate mRNA expression of GPR35 and GPR41, while SUCNR1 was expressed at a very high level (Figure S1). Next, we examined SUCNR1 expression on human primary myeloid cells and cell lines by qPCR and Western blot. We found, as expected from the screening, that SUCNR1 is abundantly expressed in primary human CBMC and LAD‐2 cells, while minimal expression is observed in human PMN (Figure 1A), as previously reported.

We incubated IgE‐sensitized CBMC (referred to as resting mast cells) with succinate or cis‐epoxysuccinate (cES) and assessed CD63 expression—a marker of degranulation, and histamine release. Succinate (1 mM) induced CD63 expression (from 2% to 5% CD63 positive cells; Figure 2A). However, this was not accompanied by a significant induction of histamine release (Figure 2B). Similar effects were observed with cES on CD63 expression and histamine release (Figure 2C,2D), suggesting that SUCNR1 activation alone only causes mild degranulation in CBMC.

SUCNR1 activation enhances mast cell degranulation and histamine release. CD63 expression or histamine release was analyzed in CBMC treated with (A‐B) succinate or (C‐D) cES for 30 min followed by anti‐IgE challenge. Dotted lines link values from the same donors.

We further activated CBMC with 0.4 μg/ml or 2 μg/ml anti‐IgE after 30 min pre‐incubation with succinate, which led to significant induction of CD63 expression and histamine release. Pre‐incubation of CBMC with succinate significantly enhanced CD63 induction relative to cells activated with anti‐IgE alone, associated with increases of histamine release (Figure 2A,2B). Compared with succinate, pre‐incubation with the synthetic SUCNR1 agonist cES caused even greater potentiation of IgE‐receptor induced CD63 expression and histamine release (Figure 2C,2D). To further evaluate the role of SUCNR1 in mast cell degranulation, a potent and selective SUCNR1 antagonist, here denoted XT1, was synthesized according to the previous literature (Compound 4c in Bhuniya et al.

With this approach, we found that XT1 binds in the canonical ligand‐binding pocket with its trifluoromethyl moiety buried deep inside the receptor, and exhibits similar binding mode and binding pocket occupancy as observed for the recently reported human specific SUCNR1 antagonist NF‐56‐EJ40

(Figure S3). Antagonizing SUCNR1 by XT1 and NF‐56‐EJ40 effectively inhibited succinate potentiated mast cell degranulation (Figure 2E–F) and histamine release (Figure 2G). Moreover, the potentiating effects of succinate and cES on IgE/anti‐IgE‐induced mast cell degranulation and histamine release were reproduced in LAD‐2 cells (Figure S4) and here shRNA knockdown of SUCNR1 attenuated the effect (Figure 2H–I, Figure S5).

In activated cells, the biosynthesis of eicosanoids requires the liberation of AA by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) from membrane phospholipids for further metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) or lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways (Figure 3A). To assess the effect of SUCNR1 activation on eicosanoid biosynthesis, we treated resting and IgE‐receptor‐activated mast cells with succinate and cES, and detected increased phosphorylation of cPLA2 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, in activated mast cells, succinate significantly and efficiently enhanced PGD2 production, associated with increased production of cys‐LTs, TXA2 (measured as its stable metabolite TXB2) and AA, as assessed by LC‐MS/MS (Figure 3C). Levels of the two major eicosanoid products, PGD2 and cys‐LTs, were further assessed by ELISA, which corroborated the potentiating effects of succinate and cES (Figure 3D,E). SUCNR1 antagonists XT1 or NF‐56‐EJ40 dose‐dependently blocked the potentiating effect of succinate on PGD2 production (Figure 3F–G). Knockdown of SUCNR1 in LAD‐2 cells attenuated succinate‐ and cES‐ enhanced cPLA2 phosphorylation (Figure 3H), PGD2 (Figure 3I) and cys‐LTs production (Figure 3J). Notably, 1 mM succinate was able to induce PGD2 release from resting LAD‐2 cells, an effect that was abolished by SUCNR1 knockdown (Figure S6).

IL‐8, the most predominant cytokine secreted by mast cells, was found to be significantly upregulated by succinate and cES with or without anti‐IgE activation (Figure 4A,B). Furthermore, succinate or cES alone induced a panel of cytokines from resting mast cells, best represented by GM‐CSF and IL‐13, as well as TNF‐α, IL‐6, IFN‐γ, IL‐5, IL‐1β, IL‐17A, and MIP1β. Moreover, activation of SUCNR1 and FcεRI signaling showed synergy in producing GM‐CSF, TNF‐α, IL‐5, IL‐13, IL‐4, IL‐2, IL‐1β, IL‐17A, and G‐CSF from human CBMC, whereas the levels of IFN‐γ, IL‐7, MCP‐1, MIP1β, or IL‐10 were not influenced by succinate or cES in activated mast cells (Figure 4C, Table S2). In addition, the relative amounts of cytokines were analyzed, and a marked change in cytokine signature was observed under SUCNR1 activating conditions (Figure 4D,E).

In line with the cytokine secretion, mRNA expression of TNF‐α and IL‐8, two of the most abundantly expressed cytokines in CBMC, were upregulated by succinate and cES, suggesting that SUCNR1 influences the transcriptional regulation of cytokine synthesis. Furthermore, the upregulation of TNF‐α and IL‐8 transcripts was blocked by YM254890, a Gq inhibitor, (Figure 4F) and cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a key family of transcription factors involved in cytokine expression in mast cells (Figure 4G). Compared with control cells, SUCNR1 deficiency dramatically reduced TNF‐α expression in succinate‐ or cES‐ treated cells (Figure 4H). Moreover, 1 μM XT1 counteracted the effects of succinate or cES on specific cytokine production in resting and activated mast cells (Figure 4I,J and Table S3).

Using CBMC or LAD‐2 cells, we found that CD63 expression was blocked by the Gq inhibitor YM254890 (Figure 5A) but not the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) (Figure S7), suggesting SUCNR1 signals through Gq to potentiate mast cell degranulation. Succinate‐ or cES‐induced a rapid and significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Figure 5B). SUCNR1 activation also enhanced ERK phosphorylation in IgE‐receptor‐activated cells (Figure 5C), an effect that could be reduced by SUCNR1 antagonist and genetic knockdown (Figure 5D). Both ERK phosphorylation and accompanying PGD2 production in LAD‐2 cells could also be blocked by PKC inhibitors Bisindolylmaleimide and Gö 6976 (Figure 5E,F), suggesting an involvement of PKC in mediating the SUCNR1 signaling in mast cells. SUCNR1 antagonists XT1 and NF‐56‐EJ40, the Gq inhibitor YM254890 and the ERK inhibitor U0126 were all able to attenuate succinate‐induced cPLA2 phosphorylation, whereas the p38 inhibitor SB203580 was without effect, demonstrating the activation of SUCNR1(Gq)‐PKC‐ERK pathway in succinate‐challenged mast cells (Figure 5G). Moreover, targeting the ERK signaling by U0126 also decreased CD63 expression potentiated by succinate (Figure S8).

To explore whether SUCNR1 activation influences allergen‐induced smooth muscle contraction in complex tissues, we performed guinea pig organ bath experiments with isolated tracheal rings from sensitized animals. Addition of OVA induced a concentration‐dependent contraction, which was shifted leftward by pretreatment with either succinate or cES (Figure 6A,B). At the highest concentration, both succinate (1 mM) and cES (1 mM) caused a significant leftward shift of the OVA‐induced contraction curve, with a significantly lower EC50 value. As observed in CBMC, cES was more potent than succinate in promoting tracheal contraction (Figure 6C,D). Increased levels of histamine and cys‐LTs were detected in the organ bath fluid of cES‐treated tissues (Figure 6E,F), which indicates that guinea pig airway mast cells become hyper‐reactive when SUCNR1 is activated. Antagonizing SUCNR1 by XT1 significantly attenuated the effects of both succinate and cES on OVA‐induced trachea contraction (Figure 6G,H) but had no significant effect on OVA‐induced contraction in the absence of SUCNR1 agonists (Figure S9), demonstrating the specificity of XT1 in targeting the receptor.

Furthermore, when tracheal contraction was triggered by exogenous histamine, LTD4, or U‐46619, which all directly activate smooth muscle cells in a mast cell‐independent manner, there was no significant effect of either 1 mM succinate or cES (Figure 6I). This indicates that SUCNR1 ligands do not directly regulate smooth muscle cells. This is in line with the receptor expression analysis in isolated airway smooth muscle cells, where no SUCNR1 transcripts were detected (data not shown).

As a final translational test, we investigated whether SUCNR1 activation could affect IgE‐induced smooth muscle cell contraction in human tissue. For this, small airways with an inner diameter of 1 mm or less were collected from patients undergoing lobectomies. In this model, 1 mM cES significantly enhanced the efficacy and the maximal response of airway contraction to anti‐IgE (Figure 6J). In addition, pretreatment with XT1 totally blocked the effect of cES (Figure 6K and Table S4), suggesting a potentiating effect of SUCNR1 signaling in human airways as observed in isolated cells and guinea pig trachea.

In this study, we find that SUCNR1 activation significantly enhances the early phase of mast cell activation with degranulation, histamine, and eicosanoid release that is induced by FcεRI crosslinking. Degranulation and histamine release are the primary outcomes of FcεRI‐induced mast cell activation, key events in allergic inflammation. PGD2 and cys‐LTs are major eicosanoid products of mast cells, whose synthesis requires cPLA2‐dependent release of free AA from phospholipids at the nuclear and ER membranes.

We find that SUCNR1 activation increases cPLA2 phosphorylation and subsequent AA release in succinate‐treated cells, demonstrating hyperactivation of an early and critical step in the eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway (Figure 3B). The increases in cys‐LTs, PGD2, and TXA2 predict a pro‐contractile effect of SUCNR1 activation in smooth muscles (Figure 6), and could contribute to other events in local inflammation, such as vasodilation and mucus secretion. Moreover, the increases in cys‐LTs and PGD2 levels may indicate a contribution of SUCNR1 activation in Type 2 inflammation in severe asthma.

Succinate promotes the release of certain cytokines from CBMC, indicating a significant impact of SUCNR1 activation on the late phase response of mast cells, and a potential to promote chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling. The effect of succinate in resting mast cells suggests a link between succinate accumulation and low‐grade inflammation. Comparing effects of SUCNR1 signaling with or without FcεRI crosslinking, reveals some qualitative differences. Thus, in resting cells, the production of the Th1 cytokine IFN‐γ was enhanced, while generation of IL‐4 was only promoted in FcεRI‐activated cells (Figure 4C–E). These results suggest that FcεRI crosslinking may shift the impact of SUCNR1 activation from a general pro‐inflammatory effect toward a more Type 2 inflammation‐oriented effect.

We report that the potentiating effect of SUCNR1 on mast cell activation is via the PTX‐insensitive Gq pathway and further downstream, the receptor connects with PKC and ERK pathways (Figure 5F,G, Figure S8). Though SUCNR1 and FcεRI activation have synergistic effects on mast cell reactivity, a link in signal transduction was mainly observed at a distal level, that is, ERK MAPK, which in turn suggests that SUCNR1 activation may affect additional functional mast cell responses involving the ERK MAPK hub, such as differentiation and cell fate determination.

In the current study, we used isolated guinea pig trachea to study effects of SUCNR1 activation in mast cell‐mediated allergic reactions of the airways and found a robust enhancement of the contractile response, which was associated with the release of histamine and cys‐LTs (Figure 6). Similar results were also observed with isolated human bronchi pointing to a role for succinate/SUCNR1 in allergic inflammation of the human airways. In mice, it has been shown that SUCNR1 is enriched in mucosal mast cells which express more β7 integrin,

It was suggested that these surprising results were caused by a defect in mouse mast cell maturation induced by global SUCNR1 deficiency. In the present study, we focused on human cells and used other experimental approaches to complement and extend the observations with knockout mice. Though mice have been widely used to study the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, they have limited predictive value for human mast cells and allergic asthma. Thus, we focused on models of allergic bronchoconstriction believed to better reflect human asthma and observed a significant effect of SUCNR1 activation on promoting airway smooth muscle contraction, a critical component of human asthma. We identify cys‐LTs and histamine as messengers downstream of the SUCNR1 receptor (Figure 6E,F), neither of which induces airway smooth muscle contraction in mice.
