Worldwide, each year over 30,000 patients undergo an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with the intent to cure high-risk hematologic malignancy, immunodeficiency, metabolic disease, or a life-threatening bone marrow failure syndrome. Despite substantial advances in donor selection and conditioning regimens and greater availability of allograft sources, transplant recipients still endure the morbidity and mortality of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Herein, we identify key aspects of acute and chronic GVHD pathophysiology, including host/donor cell effectors, gut dysbiosis, immune system and cytokine imbalance, and the interface between inflammation and tissue fibrosis. In particular, we also summarize the translational application of this heightened understanding of immune dysregulation in the design of novel therapies to prevent and treat GVHD.
